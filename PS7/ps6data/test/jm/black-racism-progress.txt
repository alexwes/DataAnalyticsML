i have argued recently that a useful and inspiring history of modern black america need not be dominated by discussions of white racism. and having done so, it seems reasonable for me to explain, to at least a limited degree, what i would envision as a potentially better approach. specifically, i wrote about a draft curriculum of the college board's advanced placement course in african american studies. so what other topics might it have included, to counterbalance topics -- clearly worthy, yet incomplete -- such as reparations, amiri baraka and the black lives matter movement? let's try, for one, the notion of black power. the good word would seem to be that we never really have any. but that isn't true, and any valid chronicle of the history of what's been happening to black americans since the 1960s must not pretend otherwise. we have now had a two-term black president, two black secretaries of state, one black (and south asian) vice president and a black secretary of defense. these were all borderline unimaginable goals a generation ago. wilton gregory, the archbishop of washington, d.c., was elevated in 2020 to become the catholic church's first black cardinal. he was the first black president of the united states conference of catholic bishops as far back as the early 2000s -- a time at which dennis archer was also the first black president of the american bar association. lowe's and walgreens, two of the nation's largest retailers, are run by black chief executives. the reason you probably didn't know that is because there are now enough black chief executives to bypass the notion of firsts. this contrasts with 2000, when there were only two prominent black chief executives of fortune 500 companies -- franklin raines at fannie mae and lloyd ward at maytag -- although that, too, was awesome progress over what had come before. successes of this kind should be held up front and center, not dismissed as footnotes or all but buried in equal coverage of remaining disparities -- although those should of course be covered elsewhere in a curriculum. the question is how people like this achieved as much as they did despite the obstacles, largely but not exclusively racial, they all faced. we might ask why there isn't more focus on that question. i often sense that we are supposed to think of people like this with a certain formulaic admiration. they are what are sometimes called "blacks in wax" (after, presumably, the museum in baltimore): nice to know about but ultimately fluky superstars irrelevant to what some might say blackness is really about. is the idea that, because they have not usually dedicated themselves to political protest in deed or gesture, it somehow makes them less impressive or less important? that itself would be a radical proposition. something else: a modern history of black america should include how black english has become, to a considerable extent, a youth lingua franca since at least the 1990s. it is absolutely a fact that attitudes toward black english can be influenced by racism. however, this is neither the most important nor even the most interesting thing about the dialect. beyond its awesome grammatical structures, it is fascinating that such a dialect primarily confined to black usage just 50 years ago now decorates the speech of countless americans who are not black at all. and that is because how black people talk has become an integral part of how america talks. in black english, "i'm going to" can be rendered as the marvelously terse "ima," as in, "ima go downstairs." thirty years ago, i overheard a white undergraduate woman use this phrase with black male friends. then, white people using it were generally ones especially identified with and situated within black culture -- i.e., with a substantially black friend group. today i hear white and asian young people use "ima" all the time; it is no longer interesting. a student of south asian heritage wrote a paper for me recently chronicling how his texting with friends, most of whom are not black, was couched considerably in black english, as a default medium with no performance or ridicule entailed. and dismissing this as cultural appropriation won't do. it'd be like jewish people complaining that non-jewish people say "klutz," "schmooze" and "shtick." black english's transformation of mainstream english has likewise been inevitable, harmless and cool. it's something great that has happened since the 1960s. a true and healthy history of black america should also cover, with the same ardor that it does the l.a. riots of 1992, the efflorescence of black film starting in the 1980s and continuing into the 2000s. after the blaxploitation film flame burned out rather quickly in the 1970s, black movies came out here and there. but starting with the electrically odd, goofy, plangent and true "she's gotta have it" by spike lee in 1986, and lee's titanic oeuvre of films in its wake, it started to get hard to see every black film that was released. (i had to give up around 1999.) the comedies were often of a kind that both taught and amused ("barbershop"); the romances gave black women especially equivalents to movies like "when harry met sally" ("love jones"); the dramas gave us our forms of movies like "terms of endearment" ("soul food"); and the gangster pictures finally gave us our james cagneys and lee marvins ("new jack city"). a line one often used to hear in response to the idea of progress in black film was that there existed no black producer who could greenlight a movie alone. but that's no longer true, now that tyler perry rules his own filmic empire. some think perry does not really count because most of his films appeal more to the gut than to the intellect. but then the vast majority of films always have, and i for one have never seen a film of perry's without at least one immortal performance of some kind, including, frequently, his own. and they are indeed often damnably funny. that black movies are now ordinary is something our historiography should chart and celebrate, much as it should a two-term black president. the prospect of a film like "black panther" even getting made on such a lavish budget, much less being an international sensation, would have sounded like science fiction as recently as the 1990s. the prospect of a high-budget sequel with a mostly black cast being made even after the star of the original had died? it beggars imagination. one last example: from the florida a.p. draft, one might suppose that the thing most interesting about hip-hop is its usage as protest music, given that in the draft music is so dominatingly associated with social and political purposes, advocacy and empowerment. certainly, protest is part of what the music is; its confrontational cadence is fundamental to the genre. but as to the idea of a hip-hop revolution whereby the music was always supposedly about to unite black america into some kind of radical political consciousness: how has that panned out? hip-hop has been a glorious revolution, indeed -- in music, period. be it party music, protest music, political music, obscene music or dr. octagon, a genre that started as street fun in the bronx has transformed the musical fabric and sensibility of america -- as well as that of the whole world. (i once watched a teen rap in indonesian in new guinea.) no one denies this, of course. but it is this basic triumph that should center its coverage in a course and be offered as a topic of engagement to curious young people. i suspect that the idea that a black historiography would not just wave at but stare at positive developments will rub some the wrong way. but the idea that our history must elevate protest as the most interesting thing about us is peculiar. it's worth noting that not that very long ago, black american movers and shakers were of a similar mind in celebrating the victories more than the -- very real -- obstacles. in 1901, an issue of the black newspaper the indianapolis recorder listed all of the city's businesses owned by black people and crowed, "if after reading the facts and figures as succinctly presented an inspiration comes to any who may be considering embarking in some business enterprise or renews hope in those who are now struggling to attain success we shall feel gratified." if a black man could write that in the era of plessy v. ferguson, surely today our curriculums on black history can recognize more clearly what black people have accomplished, continue to accomplish and accomplish more with each passing decade. just because time moves more slowly than we wish it did doesn't mean we should not recognize its motion. relaxing the impulse to hold the spotlight on what white people are doing -- or not doing, or should have done -- can be, among other things, a way to recognize what black people have accomplished in a nation that brought them across an ocean as slaves. the protest-focused perspective is rooted, it seems to me, in a take on being black that was memorably articulated by the writer ellis cose in the 1990s in "the rage of a privileged class," his widely discussed book about middle-class black people's sense of alienation: "hurtful and seemingly trivial encounters of daily existence are in the end what most of life is," cose attested, in what he described as the story of what it's like to be black in modern america. cose's weltanschauung is one especially prevalent among academics, artists and journalists. but most people -- and most black people -- are none of those three things. i have lost count of how many black people told me back in the day that they did not share cose's take on what we now call "microaggressions" as the very fabric of our existence. many do share it, to be sure, but their positions share space with those of the other millions of black americans who feel closer to the way i do. the story of black people in america is much more than the story of what's wrong with white people. to pretend that this isn't true, to downplay or ignore decades of progress and accomplishment and to portray political activism -- however important and necessary, and it is both -- as black americans' main form of accomplishment, is to suggest that white people have already won.
