mr. musk opted to drop $44 billion on a social media platform he has no clue how to run in an effort to paint himself as a free-speech crusader. all he has achieved thus far is to fuel rumors of twitter's demise, damage tesla and convince much of the world that he is less mad genius than narcissistic ass. well played. biggest winnerron desantisflorida's governor romped to re-election, capturing even the traditionally blue miami region. with national republicans drooling all over him, mr. desantis is perfectly positioned to run for the big chair in 2024. the ever-looming question: what is donald trump going to do about it? biggest loserdonald trumphis legal troubles are piling up. he backed a bunch of losers in the midterms. that upstart desantis is eating into his presidential polling numbers. and his fancy new nft trading cards have been widely mocked. in a word: sad. biggest electoral x factorthe supreme court's dobbs decisionby overturning roe v. wade, the conservative justices made abortion a red-hot campaign topic that mobilized pro-choice voters and damaged republicans in the midterms. here's hoping this is the start of an electoral trend. most likely to wind up a tin-pot dictatorkari lakethe republican contender for governor of arizona looked so promising as a next-generation maga demagogue. she had the charisma, the media savvy, the antidemocratic tendencies, the love of conspiracy theories and a loose relationship with the truth. but she lost, and her claims of voter fraud are going nowhere fast. time to see if tucker carlson needs a co-host? most outrageous political stuntmigrants on martha's vineyardwas ron desantis's flying a group of hapless migrants to this playground of the rich and famous cruel and sketchy? absolutely. but it also drew public attention to the border crisis and outraged blue-state america, both of which served his purposes. most impressive survivorbrian kempgeorgia's governor not only prevailed against donald trump's crusade to unseat him but also emerged with his brand enhanced. victory and vindication have rarely smelled sweeter. most stylish exitnancy pelosiafter 19 years herding the democratic cats, america's first female speaker and perennial badass is passing the leadership torch. the house is unlikely to produce a leader even half as effective any time soon. top con mangeorge santos -- if that's even his real namepick a campaign claim by the representative-elect from new york's third congressional district, and chances are it was false. veteran of citigroup and goldman sachs? nope. beleaguered landlord with 13 properties? nope. college grad? nope. lost four employees in the pulse nightclub shooting? nope. mysteries remain. there is an ongoing debate about his claiming to be jewish -- or was it jew-ish? and it's still unclear how, with a long trail of unpaid debts, he was in a position to loan his campaign $700,000. even in a republican party trained to embrace "alternative facts," this guy is testing the limits. best reality showthe jan. 6 committee hearingsthere may have been only two republican lawmakers on the house panel, but there was a whole host of republican consultants, lawyers and former officials on the witness list. and these folks had many disturbing things to say about donald trump's scheming to overturn the 2020 election. like some dystopian "schoolhouse rock!" video, the proceedings offered an extended civics lesson in how not to run a democracy. most likely to appear in a future season of 'white lotus'donald trump jr. and his bride-to-be, kimberly guilfoyleof course, the real genius would be to set the whole season at mar-a-lago, co-starring javanka, melania and the rest. best electoral jokedr. ozone word: crudite. worst electoral jokeherschel walkera guy who is accused by multiple women of abusive or threatening behavior (much of which he denies); revealed to have apparently semisecret kids; alleged to have paid for women to have abortions (which he also denies) -- despite his anti-abortion politics -- and seems to lie as casually as most folks breathe should never have been a serious contender for the senate. full stop. least surprising electoral outcomeflorida going red. most surprising electoral outcomenew york going red. biggest political gamblerkyrsten sinemait's one thing to be a perennial burr in your party's backside. it's quite another to quit the party and try to go it alone as an independent. even in a politically quirky place like arizona, the electoral system is not kind to third-party players. most underestimatedjoe biden. again.this year's policy wins included the chips act, the inflation reduction act, the first major gun safety legislation in decades, an overhaul of the electoral count act and a law to protect same-sex and interracial marriage. as promised, he put the first black woman on the supreme court. and, as the midterms heated up, he kept his head down as the republicans' red wave shrank to more of a pink dribble. you have to give the boring, moderate, pragmatic old guy his due. best political euphemisma tie!the republican national committee pooh-poohing the jan. 6 insurgency as "legitimate political discourse" looked tough to beat. but then came election season, and "candidate quality" roared into contention as the senate republican leader mitch mcconnell's martini-dry nod to his party's weak senate field. most likely to have a miserable 2023hunter bidenthe new republican house majority has one aim for the next congress: paralyze the biden administration with investigations. the president's son hunter makes for a juicy target. expect hunter and his infamous laptop to be the pet topic of ms. taylor greene et al for the foreseeable future. runner-upkevin mccarthywith republicans' super-skinny house majority, the next speaker will need to spend a painful amount of time sucking up to the conference's lunatic fringe. mr. mccarthy desperately wants the gig, but his best hope for a bearable 2023 might be to lose the speaker's race. would that be humiliating?
