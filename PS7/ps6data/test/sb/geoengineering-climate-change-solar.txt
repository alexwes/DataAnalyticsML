this article is part of the debatable newsletter. you can sign up here to receive it on wednesdays. last month, a two-person start-up company by the name of make sunsets claimed that it had launched weather balloons filled with reflective sulfur particles into the sky somewhere over the coast of baja california. more provocation than experiment, the launch was a first-of-its-kind field test of a climate intervention known as geoengineering: a branch of speculative technology that promises to counteract and even reverse global warming by altering earth's atmosphere. long a taboo idea among climate experts thought too dangerous even to research, geoengineering is becoming increasingly mainstream. in 2019, congress gave the national oceanic and atmospheric administration $4 million to research techniques like the one make sunsets just tested, and it has since drawn interest from the biden administration. as the world continues to fall short of the goals of the paris agreement and the costs of climate change mount, is geoengineering an idea worth taking seriously, or is it a world-historically reckless distraction from the global effort to transition away from fossil fuels? here's a look at the debate. in 1965, a group of scientific advisers delivered the first government report on global warming to president lyndon johnson. warning of calamitous sea level rise, they called for exploring "the possibilities of deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes," perhaps by brightening the oceans' surface. proposals for geoengineering have since evolved, and fall into two broad categories: carbon dioxide removal. in recent years, a handful of companies have debuted machines capable of extracting carbon dioxide from the air for underground storage or use in products that contain the compound, a process called direct air capture. other strategies for carbon removal include planting trees, fertilizing the oceans with iron to stimulate phytoplankton blooms and raising the ph of the oceans to increase their absorption of carbon dioxide and counteract the acidification that threatens marine ecosystems. solar radiation management. in 1991, a volcano in the philippines spewed 20 million tons of sun-blocking sulfur dioxide gas into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to temporarily drop by about one degree fahrenheit. this natural experiment provided the basis for the most well-known and controversial method of geoengineering, known as stratospheric aerosol injection. other solar geoengineering proposals involve brightening marine clouds with sea salt, thinning a specific type of cloud that absorbs heat and, more far-fetched, shooting giant mirrors or reflective bubbles into space. carbon removal through direct air capture is typically considered a safe and elegant form of geoengineering, but the technology is nascent, inherently slow and prohibitively expensive. for those reasons, even its supporters argue that it is best thought of as a potential way to offset the emissions from the few industries that are hard to decarbonize, like aviation. sulfur aerosol injection, on the other hand, would be relatively easy and cheap to deploy immediately at a planetary scale, costing as little as $2 billion per year. almost no proponents of geoengineering research champion it as a substitute for transitioning away from fossil fuels. rather, they argue that it could help buy humanity more time to make that transition. they also point out that because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for thousands of years, eliminating carbon emissions would only prevent the world from heating up further; it wouldn't cool the world back down, at least not for anyone alive today. even if the world managed to decarbonize by 2050, extreme weather events and sea level rise would pose a greater threat than they do now for many centuries to come. "emissions cuts are necessary," david keith, a professor of applied physics and public policy at harvard, wrote in the times in 2021. "but pretending that climate change can be solved with emissions cuts alone is a dangerous fantasy. if you want to reduce risks from the emissions already in the atmosphere -- whether that's to prevent forest fires in algeria, heat waves in british columbia or floods in germany -- you must look to carbon removal, solar geoengineering and local adaptation." if you find the prospect of experimenting on the atmosphere horrifying to contemplate, you're not alone. since last january, more than 360 climate and governance scholars have signed an open letter calling on national governments and the united nations to restrict the development of solar engineering technology, contending that it poses an "unacceptable risk," for three key reasons: the side effects are too dangerous. spraying sulfur into the stratosphere might bring down the earth's temperature, but it could also turn the sky white, change weather patterns, increase the spread of malaria, deplete the ozone layer and alter the light that plants need to grow. some regions might suffer while others benefit, creating the potential for conflict. "imagine if india started pumping sulfur into the atmosphere only to see a huge drought hit pakistan," bill mckibben wrote in the new yorker last year. "two nuclear powers, already at odds, with one convinced the other is harming its people." it's a false hope. skeptics of geoengineering warn that it could detract from efforts to transition away from fossil fuels if it were inaccurately perceived as an insurance policy against climate change. individuals might put off taking steps to reduce their carbon footprints, for example. more concerning, parties with a large stake in the fossil fuel industry might lobby for pumping sulfur into the air as an alternative to keeping oil and gas in the ground. make sunsets, the start-up, is already selling "cooling credits" as carbon offsets. "soon everyone who is dependent on coal, oil and gas will jump on the solar engineering bandwagon and say, 'we can continue for 40 years with fossil fuels' now," frank biermann, a political scientist at utrecht university, told the guardian last month. "this debate threatens to derail current climate policies. it's a huge risk." that risk stems in part from the fact that the cooling effect of sulfur lasts for only about one to two years. if humanity became dependent on aerosol injection as a substitute for decarbonization rather than a complement, it could become a kind of civilizational addiction, impossible to safely stop. "it would have to be continued without fail year after year, for 1,000 years or more -- lest the termination shock from cessation of the intervention unleash pent-up global warming that would fry the planet in a matter of decades," wrote raymond pierrehumbert, an oxford physicist, in 2020. "the disastrous consequences of termination shock would grow as we cower year after year under the flimsy stratospheric sunshade, hoping that technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere on a massive scale becomes practical before disaster strikes." it's undemocratic. because solar geoengineering would affect the whole world, "countries powerful enough to develop and deploy technologies for solar geoengineering would need to place their technologies under the control of effective multilateral institutions, with guarantees of collective veto rights for the most vulnerable nations," an extended version of the open letter argues. "the current world order seems unfit to reach such far-reaching agreements on fair and effective political control over solar geoengineering deployment." proponents of solar geoengineering research often discuss the technology as an inevitability: global warming may reach a point where the world becomes desperate enough to try blocking the sun with sulfur -- and given how cheap it would be, relatively speaking, a rogue country (or billionaire) just might do so unilaterally, with or without knowledge of the potential consequences. some countries, particularly less developed and low-lying ones, may be closer to crossing that theoretical threshold than others. "geoengineering as a possible solution to this catastrophe will definitely become the only option of last resort if we as a global community continue on the path we have been going," anote tong, a former president of kiribati, a pacific island nation on the front lines of sea level rise, told the new yorker. "there will be a point when it has to be either geoengineering or total destruction." in 2019, a survey of international climate policy negotiators found that support for geoengineering was higher among respondents who expected severe climate change damages in their home country. if that relationship persists as the world warms, calls for more research, at least, may become louder and more difficult to defy. "no scientist is happy about the prospect of solar geoengineering," holly jean buck, a professor of environment and sustainability at the university at buffalo, wrote in mit technology review last year. "but we are going to need a pipeline of thoughtful, experienced people who understand both the science and the governance issues. if we disincentivize people from developing that expertise, we may not like the results." there are signs that the geoengineering research taboo is already fading. in 2021, the influential national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine issued a report urging the u.s. government to spend between $100 million and $200 million to research solar geoengineering. how efforts such as this might affect public opinion is difficult to predict. michael gerrard, the director of the sabin center for climate change law at columbia law school and the editor of a book on solar geoengineering, told the times that rather than inducing apathy about climate change, a large new federal research program into geoengineering might have the opposite effect. "it could be so scary," he suggested, "that people will be even more motivated to reduce emissions." do you have a point of view we missed? email us at debatable@nytimes.com. please note your name, age and location in your response, which may be included in the next newsletter.
