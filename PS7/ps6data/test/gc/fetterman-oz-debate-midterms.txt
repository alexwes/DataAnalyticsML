so, how many of you watched the pennsylvania senate debate because you want to back the most articulate candidate? the whole country was wondering how well john fetterman was doing, given his auditory processing issues. he can get his thoughts across, but there aren't going to be any oratory prizes in the immediate future. if one of those had been given out on tuesday night, mehmet oz, the republican candidate, would have won. big shock, right? the former television talk-show star was more articulate than the guy who had a stroke. but deep down, nothing made much difference. most viewers knew who they were going to support before the debate began. hundreds of thousands of them had already voted. makes total sense. the most important thing about this election, by far, is that it could decide who will control the senate. there, the big votes are almost always divided by party. be honest -- were you really surprised that fetterman was the one who wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15? or that oz is the one who would protect the filibuster? at this point, party is all that matters. still, there we were, trying to judge how the guys performed. on occasion, it was a little hard to tell whether fetterman's answers constituted normal political evasion or stroke-induced confusion. for instance, he'd once said he'd never support the very lucrative fracking industry, which many pennsylvania workers love and virtually all pennsylvania environmentalists hate. then he changed his mind. on tuesday, he said: "i do support fracking. and i don't, i don't. i support fracking, and i stand, and i do, support fracking." that was it, and a very good example of how the repercussions from a stroke can make it much more difficult for a politician to achieve classic dodge-and-switcheroo. unfortunately, given fetterman's trouble with quick repartee, he didn't throw in a reminder of his opponent's very recent metamorphosis into a pennsylvania resident, or more than a quick jab about how oz, who doesn't seem worried about the minimum wage, is the guy with "10 gigantic mansions." true enough. would have loved to pursue that a little bit -- i wonder whether oz couldn't be lending one of his manhattan condos to the homeless. or displaced venezuelan refugees? issue-wise, the big faux pas of the evening actually came from oz, who flubbed his answer to an abortion question. the good doctor has, um, evolved since he was dispensing medical advice on tv. he was slightly vague but apparently pro-choice back then. once he became an ambitious republican politician, he discovered he was "100 percent pro-life." now that he's running in a general election, he's trying to jump back to the old between-a-woman-and-her-doctor territory. sort of. on stage this week, he called for a decision made by "women, doctors, local political leaders ..." hmm, how many of you want to bring the local political leaders into this? may i see a show of hands? oz seemed unthrilled about being asked if he'd back donald trump for the 2024 nomination. which was a little ungrateful, given that he was probably on stage only because trump had endorsed him in the republican primary. bringing up the former president was yet another reminder that our main concern right now is about which party wins control. if you want a senate that's going to reject anything that comes out of a biden white house, feel free to consider the republican candidates. otherwise, come on ... i know, it's tough. voters have less than two weeks to make a choice, and in a fair world they'd be able to think about more than that one big thing. what about fetterman's long-term prognosis? after the debate, his spokesman said he did "great tonight for a man who was in a hospital bed just several months ago." that's true, but it's not a qualification voters would want to hear for the next six years. you certainly hope he'll at least be able to get up and go to work. but whatever his condition, don't express your concern by helping turn the senate over to mitch mcconnell. if you've got a local election for governor or mayor, feel free to mull the character details. they're the ones whose personality, self-discipline and charisma really matter. for instance, watching the gubernatorial candidates in new york, kathy hochul and challenger lee zeldin, go at it this week, you got to hear people talk about stuff they could actually do on their own, and not in a pack with 49 or 50 of their colleagues. true, it wasn't the most stirring debate in state history and objective viewers might have found zeldin a tad off-putting. (he opened with a rant about how wretched everything was, to which hochul mildly replied, "well, nice to see you too ...") yeah, if you've got to vote for an executive, you do need to pay close attention. take some of the time you were going to devote to those senate races. on that front, you should have been homing in at primary time, when they picked the candidates. now, the republican and democratic nominees are who they are. and the oratory certainly doesn't matter. when was the last time a friend told you she'd changed her mind about a big issue after a rousing speech by senator x? well, it did sort of work for jimmy stewart in "mr. smith goes to washington." but that was 30 years before john fetterman was born. and it was a movie.
