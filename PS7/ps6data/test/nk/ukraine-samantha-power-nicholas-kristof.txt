samantha power: i think if they were to be abandoned in their hour of need, that is a much more dangerous world and a much crueler world than the one we want to see. kristof: here's our conversation. samantha, you and i have both visited ukraine. my takeaway was twofold, that the russian strategy wasn't just military and inflicting military casualties, but very much about just inflicting misery and war crimes on the public. and the second takeaway was just the public's extraordinary strength and resilience in ukraine. there was one young woman i'll never forget who -- her boyfriend had signed up on the first day of the war, was on the front. he had proposed to her from the front line and then he was killed and she had then enlisted. and i said, you know, why are you here? and she said, "they killed the man i love. where else can i be?" and i'm curious what struck you about where ukraine is and about the u.s. responsibility to help. power: it's just so obvious to every individual, almost at every age, that in order to protect their country, in order to protect their families, that they have to do something. many, many young men and women going to the front, many, many young men and women, you know, not coming home from the front. but even people who aren't on the front, the kind of what they call the "other war," right? the war to strengthen their democracy, to build their institutions. this is an all-society ukrainian response. it has to be an all-sector international response. in our efforts, we are not only doing the visible provision of humanitarian assistance to people who have been displaced or have lost their homes, or who've been raped and need counseling. we're not only actually funding a lot of the war crimes documentation efforts in order to pave the way for accountability at some point someday. but at the same time, we are involved in funding efforts at ensuring judicial integrity, which is intrinsically important to building ukraine's democracy and its integration plans to get into europe at some point, but also really important in terms of assuring the taxpayer, the american taxpayer, that their resources are being well spent. so continuing to strengthen the national anti-corruption bureau. and lastly, nick, just on energy, you know, energy is an existential issue. and so we absolutely have to be able to procure the pipes and the boilers and the generators and things that will help ukraine keep up its morale so it can fight all these other fights at once. kristof: initially, i was really quite concerned about whether republicans would support aid in general for ukraine. there's a little more skepticism about the budget support, about the economic aid, you know, even though it's pretty clear that putin is waging war not only on the ukrainian army, but also on the ukrainian economy. do you likewise have the sense that there is maybe a little more resistance in congress to the economic aid than to the military aid? and what is the case for the economic aid as opposed to those tanks and perhaps next fighter aircraft? power: it would be shortsighted to think that ukraine can achieve battlefield victories while the lights are going out, i.e., when people are freezing or when the government can't pay civil servants. i think it would be a mistake to think that that won't undermine the war effort. at the same time, we need to make sure that there are watchdogs, and that's a huge part of the development assistance that we provide. i also think, you know, there's no shortage of just straight up compassion. you know, i've been emphasizing our development investments because those are investments in institutions. those are investments in energy infrastructure and war crimes documentation. i think that we tell that story properly and it's well understood how modest those investments are and how big the yield is, i think people can be brought around to really seeing the utility of that. you know, i don't see anybody in the mainstream in congress turning their back on women who've been gang-raped by russian soldiers. well, that's some of our protection support and our psychosocial support. you know, i can't see people wanting not to provide access to the kind of assistance that the world food program provides, to allow people to be able to feed their families or to keep their kids in school through unicef's support on the ground. so once you kind of detail what these individual allocations of resources are doing, i think the story becomes much easier to tell. and the case for maintaining funding and indeed investing in new areas of need becomes very, very compelling. this is what these resources are going to, and this is money well spent. indeed, without it, the other investments may come to feel quite pyrrhic. kristof: so, samantha, last question. you know, there are a lot of americans, i think, who are sympathetic to what ukrainians are going through, but they also, you know, they're worried about inflation, they're worried about taxes. and they say, well, maybe if we solve the problems in our own backyard before worrying about ukraine. so what do you say to an average american who is concerned but says, well, maybe there are limits to how much we should provide? power: i think the importance is for us to get out of our bubbles and really engage with people who may, you know, a year in now be sort of tiring of these investments and to just bring it back to first principles of, you know, what would it mean for ourselves and for our kids and their kids to live in a world where a brutal dictator who's locked up all of his opposition, expelled civil society organizations, shuttered independent media, surrounded himself by yes men, for that individual, for that worldview, for that system, for that government, for that military, to be able to brutally invade a neighbor that wanted to do nothing more than choose for itself its own destiny. you know, the american revolution was born of a longing not only for freedom, but for independence. and here we have in our lifetime, right now, an effort to brutalize a population for nothing more than its desire to experience freedom and choose for itself and be an independent country. and so while it may seem far away and certainly the investments are substantial and the war has gone on longer than anybody would have wished, to imagine what the world would look like if that kind of aggression and brutality were to pay. and if those who are willing to give their lives for the cause of freedom and independence, if they were to be abandoned in their hour of need, i think that is a much more dangerous world and a much crueler world than the one we want to see. kristof: thanks very much to samantha power of the u.s. agency for international development for joining us. and thank all of you for listening to this new york times live event. you can find out about future live events by following us on twitter @nytimesevents. have a great day. this transcript was created using speech recognition software. while it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. please review the audio before quoting from this transcript and email events@nytimes.com with any questions.
