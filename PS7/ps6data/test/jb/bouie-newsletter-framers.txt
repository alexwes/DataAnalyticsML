one of the articles i'm sharing this week is an essay on the supreme court's gun rights jurisprudence by heidi li feldman and dahlia lithwick at slate. in particular, they look at the ways that the court's decision in new york state rifle & pistol association v. bruen has led lower court judges to invalidate longstanding gun regulations, on the argument that they are too unlike laws from the late 18th century to pass constitutional muster. the reason i want to elaborate on this point is that feldman and lithwick make an argument that really struck me with its power. their critique of the court's originalism is that, among other features, it rests on a cramped view of the framers of the constitution and their ability to think and reason. in the hands of justices clarence thomas and samuel alito and other conservatives on the supreme court, the founding fathers are small-minded and provincial, unable to think beyond the narrowest possible interpretation of the words they wrote. of course, we know this isn't true. a large part of the reason that so many americans hold the framers in such high esteem is precisely that they were farsighted and creative in response to the challenge of building a new political order. they made egregious errors and terrible mistakes -- one of which almost doomed the republic -- but they also built a constitution sturdy enough to survive much longer than they thought the union would. feldman and lithwick write: ultimately, there's no outarguing a conservative court majority intent on writing its partisan policy preferences into constitutional law. but the battle to change the court -- either in its composition or the scope of its power -- is a long one. in fighting that battle, one could do worse than to try to recover the framers as they actually were: ambitious politicians who worked under a unique set of experiences with a broad set of analogies to solve practical problems and whose creativity and analytical reasoning were a far cry from the small-minded framers conjured by the most conservative members of the current supreme court. this week, i took representative marjorie taylor greene's call for a "national divorce" as a point of departure for thinking about federalism, political conflict and democracy: i was on slate's "culture gabfest" to discuss the new polish film "eo" and joined the "know your enemy" podcast to discuss the work of john le carre. lisa whiteman on the mule drivers of central north carolina for the bitter southerner. erik baker on the train derailment in east palestine, ohio, for n+1. david s. reynolds reviews kerri greenidge's new history of the abolitionist grimke family for the new york review of books. jared anthony loggins on memoir and the south for dissent. heidi li feldman and dahlia lithwick on the uses and abuses of the framers for slate. i was in hawaii last december on a teaching fellowship, and i finally got around to developing my film and editing my digital photos. this is a mural of barack obama in downtown honolulu, which i saw while taking a long walk on a day i had some free time. i used my leica range finder camera and ilford black and white film. this is a very easy meal that pairs well with pretty much any protein you can imagine, although i'm partial to pan-fried fish. consider using more garlic, lemon zest and herbs than the recipe calls for, especially if, like me, you're a fan of this particular flavor profile. recipe from the cooking section of the new york times. ingredients directions heat a 10-inch skillet over medium, then melt butter, 30 seconds to 1 minute. stir in about three-quarters of the scallions (saving some of the green parts for garnish) and garlic and cook until softened, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. stir in spinach, adding in batches if it doesn't all fit in the pan at once, and  1/2  teaspoon salt. continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. stir in stock and bring to a simmer. stir in orzo, lemon zest and remaining  1/2  teaspoon salt. cover and simmer over medium-low heat until orzo is nearly cooked through and most of the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 14 minutes, stirring once or twice. stir in cheese, peas (if you like) and dill, cover the pan and cook for another 1 minute to finish cooking and warm the peas. to serve, sprinkle with more cheese and the reserved scallions. thank you for being a subscriber read past editions of the newsletter here. if you're enjoying what you're reading, please consider recommending it to others. they can sign up here. browse all of our subscriber-only newsletters here. have feedback? send me a note at jamelle-newsletter@nytimes.com. you can also follow me on twitter (@jbouie), instagram and tiktok.
