over the past decade, a liberal faction within america's colleges and universities, corporate america and the media has promoted goals of diversity, equity and inclusion, endorsed regulations restricting "harmful speech," encouraged the ostracization of dissenters and sought to grant enhanced status to the previously marginalized. now, in reaction, come the governor of florida, ron desantis, his allies in the state legislature and republican politicians across america with a blunt-force counteragenda that uses the coercive power of government to impose its own speech code and ideology on education, including higher education, as well as on private businesses. in this, desantis and his emulators are demonstrating that the hard right is willing not only to jettison the conservative principle of restrained government but also to endanger the accreditation of a state system of higher education -- a crucial pillar of economic growth -- in order to promulgate their own repressive version of permissible language in america's universities and colleges, which have traditionally been bastions of academic freedom. "we want education, not indoctrination," desantis proclaimed recently while setting out what cannot be taught and what must be taught in florida's extensive network of postsecondary schools. many who have in the past been sharply critical of progressive excess now see desantis as promoting excess on the right. amna khalid, a history professor at carleton college in minnesota, has written extensively in the chronicle of higher education and other publications on such subjects as "yes, d.e.i. can erode academic freedom. let's not pretend otherwise" and "the data is in -- trigger warnings don't work." however, when i asked khalid about legislation in florida (hb 999) that would codify desantis's higher education proposals into law, she emailed back: what's most dangerous about the bill, khalid continued, in addition, khalid wrote, the measure "empowers university presidents and boards of trustees" (board members are appointed by the governor) khalid is by no means alone among those who have turned their fire on desantis. musa al-gharbi, a sociologist at columbia and a research fellow at the heterodox academy, noted in an email that al-gharbi, however, is equally critical of desantis: many of the laws being passed, al-gharbi wrote, what is the focus of the controversy? on jan. 31 the desantis administration issued a set of proposals, under the headline "governor desantis elevates civil discourse and intellectual freedom in higher education," to "further push back against the tactics of liberal elites who suppress free thought in the name of identity politics and indoctrination" to ensure that desantis's proposals were subsequently introduced in legislative form as hb 999 by state representative alex andrade of pensacola. among the provisions: desantis is playing with fire. in a february inside higher education article, brian rosenberg, a president emeritus of macalester college in minnesota and a visiting professor at the graduate school of education at harvard, raised the issue of accreditation. he cited the standards used by the southern association of colleges and schools commission on colleges, which suggest that desantis's proposals could result in the revocation of accreditation by the commission. among the standards rosenberg points to are: i wrote to a number of experts in education policy -- across the ideological spectrum -- asking for their "take on ron desantis's latest education reform proposals and the legislation introduced by his allies in the florida house, hb 999. are his proposals a legitimate effort to restrain liberal ideological excesses, or do they represent the use of the coercive power of government to impose an agenda on schools and colleges or somewhere in between?" very few conservatives voiced concern, in response to my inquiry, over the use of government to set an ideological agenda. yoram hazony, chairman of the edmund burke foundation, replied to me by email: along similar lines, nate hochman, a staff writer at national review, emailed to say: hochman argued: one of the conservatives i contacted raised constitutional questions about desantis's approach while voicing overall approval. adam kissel, a former deputy assistant secretary of education in the trump administration and now a visiting fellow at the heritage foundation's center for education policy, wrote: "rather than respond in terms of ideology, i would say his proposals are a welcome effort to return public colleges and universities to their traditional, core mission of seeking out and transmitting knowledge." but, kissel added, hb 999 "has some constitutional infirmities, especially viewpoint interventions that are likely to fail in court. the unconstitutional provisions can easily be reworded or omitted, leaving several excellent features intact." kissel described how to deal with those infirmities in an essay published by the federalist, "the smart lawmaker's guide to writing anti-critical race theory laws that will stand up in court." what is striking about most of the responses i received from conservatives is the minimization or complete absence of concern over the politicization of higher education when the driving force is from the right. one exception is robert pondiscio, a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute, who addressed the complexity of the debate in an email: in contrast, students in colleges and universities, pondiscio continued, desantis, in turn, has demonstrated the quintessential politicization of higher education in his takeover of new college, a small progressive public college on sarasota bay that has described itself as a "community of freethinkers, risk takers and trailblazers" while winning relatively high marks from ranking organizations like u.s. news & world report, forbes, kiplinger's and the princeton review. in january, desantis replaced six of the 13 members on the college's board of trustees with such conservative ideologues as christopher rufo of the manhattan institute; matthew spalding, professor in constitutional government at hillsdale college; charles r. kesler, a professor of government at claremont-mckenna college and the editor of the claremont review of books; mark bauerlein, a senior editor at first things and a professor emeritus of english at emory university; and jason speir, a founder of the inspiration academy, a private christian school in bradenton, fla., and the author of the article "'florida, where woke goes to die,' what does it mean?" on jan. 29, speir posted on his substack his plan, as a member of the board of trustees, to "declare that all hiring and salaries changes be frozen" to "employ a zero-based budgeting policy of terminating all contracts for faculty, staff and administration and immediately rehiring those faculty, staff and administration who fit in the new financial and business model"; to ask "for a legal opinion regarding our ability to remove tenure from new college of florida" and to "create a curriculum review committee." speir called on the board to root out from the new college curriculum he also called for a prohibition of "aspects of wokeness that are in essence pledges of fealty," which, he argued, are antithetical to floridians' shared values. he added, "one such example of a pledge of fealty is the demand that woke pronouns are used." on feb. 28, rufo posted his own plans for new college on twitter: in some respects, desantis has been on target in his critique of contemporary education both at the k-12 level and in colleges and universities. many d.e.i. initiatives have been found to be ineffective or counterproductive. some of the leading proponents of critical race theory make intellectually questionable assumptions. desantis promises to "elevate civil discourse and intellectual freedom in higher education, further pushing back against the tactics of liberal elites who suppress free thought in the name of identity politics and indoctrination." as he leads the charge against what he describes as a corrupt and bankrupt left, however, he not only calls for the substitution of one ideology for another but also appears to be willing to potentially damage the credentials of florida's highly ranked public university and college system. desantis faces a strategic problem. as a graduate of yale college and harvard law school -- bastions of the liberal intellectual elite -- he fully understands "academic rigor" and "standards of excellence." nonetheless, he has adopted tactics for his expected presidential bid that, in the trump era, require the abdication of reason. he is now feeding red meat to an enraged, predominantly non-college-educated republican electorate. so far, politically speaking, this strategy has worked well in florida, but what desantis sees as the need to continually outflank trump has pushed him into dangerous territory, where his proposals threaten to become liabilities in a general election. he faces the dilemma of going too far or not far enough. does he really need to use a bludgeon to make his point?
