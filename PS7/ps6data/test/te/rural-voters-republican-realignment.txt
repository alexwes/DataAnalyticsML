rural america has become the republican party's life preserver. less densely settled regions of the country, crucial to the creation of congressional and legislative districts favorable to conservatives, are a pillar of the party's strength in the house and the senate and a decisive factor in the rightward tilt of the electoral college. republican gains in such sparsely populated areas are compensating for setbacks in increasingly diverse suburbs where growing numbers of well-educated voters have renounced a party led by donald trump and his loyalists. the anger and resentment felt by rural voters toward the democratic party are driving a regional realignment similar to the upheaval in the white south after democrats, led by president lyndon johnson, won approval of the civil rights act of 1964. even so, republicans are grasping at a weak reed. in a 2022 article, "rural america lost population over the past decade for the first time in history," kenneth johnson, the senior demographer at the carsey school of public policy and a professor of sociology at the university of new hampshire, notes: "between 2010 and 2020, rural america lost population for the first time in history as economic turbulence had a significant demographic impact. the rural population loss was due to fewer births, more deaths and more people leaving than moving in." the shift to the right in rural counties is one side of a two-part geographic transformation of the electorate, according to "the increase in partisan segregation in the united states," a 2022 paper by jacob r. brown of princeton, enrico cantoni of the university of bologna, ryan d. enos of harvard, vincent pons of harvard business school and emilie sartre of brown. in an email, brown described one of the central findings of the study: there are few, if any, better case studies of rural realignment and the role it plays in elections than the 2022 senate race in wisconsin. the basic question there is how ron johnson -- a trump acolyte who derided climate change with an epithet, who described the jan. 6 insurrectionists as "people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement" and who proposed turning social security and medicare into discretionary programs subject to annual congressional budget cutting -- got re-elected in wisconsin. in 2016, johnson rode trump's coattails and the republican trail blazed by the former governor scott walker to a 3.4 point (50.2 to 46.8) victory and swept into office, in large part by running up huge margins in milwaukee's predominantly white suburbs. that changed in 2022. craig gilbert, a fellow at marquette law school and a former washington bureau chief of the milwaukee journal sentinel, conducted a detailed analysis of wisconsin voting patterns and found that johnson so again, how did johnson win? the simple answer: white rural wisconsin. as recently as 17 years ago, rural wisconsin was a battleground. in 2006, jim doyle, the democratic candidate for governor, won rural wisconsin, about 30 percent of the electorate, by 5.5 points. "then came the rural red wave," gilbert writes. "walker carried wisconsin's towns by 23 points in 2010 and by 25 points in 2014." in 2016, johnson won the rural vote by 25 points, but in 2022, he pushed his margin there to 29 points. in her groundbreaking study of wisconsin voters, "the politics of resentment: rural consciousness in wisconsin and the rise of scott walker," katherine cramer, a political scientist at the university of wisconsin-madison, prompted a surge of interest in this declining segment of the electorate. she summed up the basis for the discontent among these voters, saying, "it had three elements: (1) a belief that rural areas are ignored by decision makers, including policymakers, (2) a perception that rural areas do not get their fair share of resources and (3) a sense that rural folks have fundamentally distinct values and lifestyles, which are misunderstood and disrespected by city folks." david hopkins, a political scientist at boston college, described how the urban-rural partisan divide was driven by a conflation of cultural and racial controversies starting in the late 1980s and accelerating into the 1990s in his book "red fighting blue: how geography and electoral rules polarize american politics." these controversies included two supreme court abortion decisions, webster v. reproductive health services (in 1989) and planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v. casey (in 1992); the 1989 appointment of ralph reed as executive director of the christian coalition; the fire-breathing speeches of pat robertson and pat buchanan at the 1992 republican convention (buchanan: "there is a religious war going on in this country. it is a cultural war for the soul of america"); and the 1993 debate about gays in the military, to name just a few. "the 1992 election represented a milestone," hopkins writes, adding: in retrospect it is clear, hopkins goes on to say, that "the 1992 presidential election began to signal the emerging configuration of 'red' and 'blue' geographic coalitions that came to define contemporary partisan competition." hopkins compares voter trends in large metro areas, small metro areas and rural areas. through the three elections from 1980 to 1988, the urban, suburban and rural regions differed in their vote by a relatively modest five points. that begins to change in 1992, when the urban-rural difference grows to roughly 8 percentage points and then keeps growing to reach nearly 24 points in 2016. "for the first time in american history, the democratic party now draws most of its popular support from the suburbs," hopkins writes in a 2019 paper, "the suburbanization of the democratic party, 1992-2018." democratic suburban growth, he continues, "has been especially concentrated in the nation's largest metropolitan areas, reflecting the combined presence of both relatively liberal whites (across education levels) and substantial minority populations, but suburbs elsewhere remain decidedly, even increasingly, republican in their collective partisan alignment." the same process took place in house elections, hopkins observes: hopkins pointedly notes that "the expanded presence of suburban voters and representatives in the democratic party since the 1980s was accompanied by a dramatic contraction of democratic strength in rural areas." justin gest, a political scientist at george mason university whose research -- presented in "the white working class" and "majority minority" -- focuses on cultural and class tensions, has a different but complementary take, writing by email that the rising salience of cultural conflicts "was accelerated when the clinton administration embraced corporate neoliberalism, free trade and moved democrats toward the economic center. many differences persisted, but the so-called third way made it harder to distinguish between the economic approaches of democrats and republicans." the diminution of partisan economic differences resulted in the accentuation of the upper midwest, gest continued, is gest is outspoken in his criticism of the democratic party's dealings with rural communities: one of the dangers for democrats, gest continued, is that "republicans are now beginning to attract socioeconomically ascendant and white-adjacent members of ethnic minorities who find their nostalgic, populist, nationalist politics appealing (or think democrats are growing too extreme)." nicholas jacobs and kal munis, political scientists at colby college and utah valley university, argue that mounting rural resentment over marginalization from the mainstream and urban disparagement are driving forces in the growing strength of the republican party in sparsely populated regions of america. in their 2022 paper "place-based resentment in contemporary u.s. elections: the individual sources of america's urban-rural divide," jacobs and munis contend that an analysis of voting in 2018 and 2020 shows that while "place-based resentment" can be found in cities, suburbs and rural communities, it "was only consistently predictive of vote choice for rural voters." in this respect, conditions in rural areas have worsened, with an exodus of jobs and educated young people, which in turn increases the vulnerability of the communities to adverse, negative resentment. "rural america," jacobs and munis write, in their 2022 paper "symbolic versus material concerns of rural consciousness in the united states," kristin lunz trujillo, a postdoctoral research fellow at harvard's kennedy school, and zack crowley, a ph.d. candidate in political science at the university of minnesota, sought to determine the key factor driving rural voters to the republican party: anger at perceived unfair distribution of resources by government, a sense of being ignored by decision makers or the belief that rural communities have a distinct set of values that are denigrated by urban dwellers. trujillo and crowley conclude that "culture differences play a far stronger role in determining the vote than discontent over the distribution of economic resources." stands on what they call symbolic issues "positively predict trump support and ideology while the more material subdimension negatively predicts these outcomes, if at all." while rural america has moved to the right, trujillo and crowley point out that there is considerable variation: "poorer and/or farming-dependent communities voted more conservative, while amenity- or recreation-based rural economies voted more liberal in 2012 and 2016," and the "local economies of republican-leaning districts are declining in terms of income and gross domestic product, while democratic-leaning districts are improving." the trujillo-crowley analysis suggests that democratic efforts to regain support in rural communities face the task of somehow ameliorating conflicts over values, religion and family structure, which is far more difficult than lessening economic tensions that can be addressed through legislation. the hurdle facing democrats is reflected in a comment james gimpel, a political scientist at the university of maryland, emailed to me, describing the roots of rural discontent with democratic urban america: a may 2018 pew research center report, "what unites and divides urban, suburban and rural communities," found large differences in the views and partisanship in these three constituencies. urban voters, according to pew, were, for example, 62 percent democratic and 31 percent republican -- the opposite of rural voters, 54 percent republican and 38 percent democratic. fifty-three percent of those living in urban areas said rural residents have "different values," and 58 percent of those living in rural communities said urban residents do not share their values. sixty-one percent of those living in rural communities said they have "a neighbor they would trust with a set of keys to their home" compared with 48 percent in urban areas. i asked maria kefalas, a sociologist at saint joseph's university who wrote "hollowing out the middle: the rural brain drain and what it means for america" with her husband, patrick j. carr, who died in 2020, to describe the state of mind in rural america. she wrote back by email: those whom kefalas and carr defined as "stayers" shaped "the political landscape in ohio, iowa, etc. (states where the public university is just exporting its professional class)." the result: "you see a striking concentration/segregation of folks on both sides who are just immersed in maga world or not," kefalas wrote, noting that "people who live in rural america are surrounded by folks who play along with a particular worldview, yet my friends from brooklyn and boston will tell you they don't know anyone who supports trump or won't get vaccinated. it's not open warfare. it's more like apartheid." urban-rural "apartheid" further reinforces ideological and affective polarization. the geographic separation of republicans and democrats makes partisan crosscutting experiences at work, in friendships, in community gatherings, at school or in local government -- all key to reducing polarization -- increasingly unlikely to occur. geographic barriers between republicans and democrats -- of those holding traditional values and those choosing to reject or reinterpret those values -- reinforce what scholars now call the calcification of difference. as conflict and hostility become embedded in the structure of where people live, the likelihood increases of seeing adversaries as less than fully human.
