donald trump's 2016 election victory continues to confound election experts. how could american voters put such a fractious figure into the white house? this is more than an academic question. for the third time, trump is the leading candidate for the republican presidential nomination. three books, published in the years following trump's election -- "identity crisis: the 2016 presidential campaign and the battle for the meaning of america" by john sides of vanderbilt, michael tesler of the university of california-irvine and lynn vavreck of u.c.l.a.; "white identity politics" by ashley jardina of george mason university; and "uncivil agreement: how politics became our identity" by lilliana mason of johns hopkins -- shed light on trump's improbable political longevity. each points to the centrality of racial animosity. sides, tesler and vavreck, for example, cite 2016 american national election studies data that asked four questions in order to explore dimensions of white identity: "the importance of white identity, how much whites are being discriminated against, the likelihood that whites are losing jobs to nonwhites, and the importance of whites working together to change laws unfair to whites." the authors combine these questions into a "scale capturing the strength of white identity and found that it was strongly related to republicans' support for donald trump." "strongly related" is an understatement. on a 17-point scale ranking the strength of republican primary voters' white identity from lowest to highest, support for trump grew consistently at each step -- from 2 percent at the bottom to 81 percent at the highest level. now, this earlier scholarship notwithstanding, three political scientists are presenting an alternative interpretation of the 2016 election. in their feb. 28 paper "measuring the contribution of voting blocs to election outcomes," justin grimmer of stanford, william marble of the university of pennsylvania and cole tanigawa-lau, also of stanford, write: how could these two seemingly contradictory statements both be true? grimmer, marble and tanigawa-lau write: in an email, marble provided more detail: i asked grimmer to explain the significance of his work with marble and tanigawa-lau. responding by email, grimmer wrote: the data, grimmer continued, i asked sides, tesler and vavreck for their assessment of the grimmer, marble and tanigawa-lau paper. they provided a one-paragraph response affirming, in the phrase "identity-inflected issues," the crucial role of racial resentment: john kane, a political scientist at n.y.u. and an author with lilliana mason and julie wronski of "activating animus: the uniquely social roots of trump support," which was cited in the grimmer paper, suggested that the grimmer paper in fact provides a key corrective to the debate over the 2016 election. in an email, kane pointed to a key section that reads: grimmer's point, kane wrote, is that said, kane continued, other scholars who have explored issues of race and politics were generally supportive of the grimmer paper. andrew engelhardt, a political scientist at the university of north carolina-greensboro, wrote by email: the grimmer paper, engelhardt continued, "encourages us to take a step back and focus on the big picture for understanding elections: where do most votes come from and are these patterns consistent across elections?" along these lines, according to engelhardt, "i like this piece," alexander george theodoridis, a political scientist at the university of massachusetts-amherst, wrote. "it is a nice reminder for scholars and, especially, the media, that it is important to think carefully about base rates." in his email, theodoridis argued: theodoridis noted that his one sean westwood, a political scientist at dartmouth, was explicitly supportive of the grimmer-marble-tanigawa-lau methodology. writing by email, westwood argued: westwood contends that the grimmer paper, according to westwood, has significant implications for those making "general claims about the future republican party," specifically challenging those who believe trump, westwood concluded, "found support from both racists and moderates, but with the pool of racist voters shrinking, it is clear this is not a path to future victory." other scholars were more cautious in their response to the grimmer paper. daniel hopkins, a political scientist at the university of pennsylvania, commented by email: hopkins said his paper demonstrates that one clear benefit emerging from the continuing study of trump's 2016 victory is a better understanding of the complexity and nuance of what brought it about. marc hetherington, a political scientist at the university of north carolina, pointed out in an email that the presence of racial resentment among republican voters emerged long before trump ran for president, while such resentment among democratic voters has been sharply declining: while the focus of attention has been on those who fall at the high end of the distribution on racial resentment, hetherington wrote, i began my examination of the grimmer paper concerned that he and his co-authors might be drawing large conclusions from statistical oddities. after further examining the data and going over the commentary of the scholars i contacted, my own view is that grimmer, marble and tanigawa-lau have made a significant contribution to understanding the trump phenomenon. most important, they make the case that explanations of trump's victory pointing to the role of those at the extremes on measures of racial resentment and sexism, while informative, are in their own way too comforting, fostering the belief that trump's triumph was the product of voters who have drifted far from the american mainstream. in fact, the new analysis suggests that trumpism has found fertile ground across a broad swath of the electorate, including many firmly in the mainstream. that trump could capture the hearts and minds of these voters suggests that whatever he represents beyond racial resentment -- anger, chaos, nihilism, hostility -- is more powerful than many recognize or acknowledge. restoring american politics to an even keel will be far tougher than many of us realize.
