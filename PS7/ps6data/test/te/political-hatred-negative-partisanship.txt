affective polarization -- "a poisonous cocktail of othering, aversion and moralization" -- has prompted an explosion of research as the threat to democratic norms and procedures mounts. intensely felt divisions over race, ethnicity and culture have become more deeply entrenched in the american political system, reflected in part in the election denialism found in roughly a third of the electorate and in state legislative initiatives giving politicians the power to overturn election results. many researchers have begun to focus on this question: is there a causal relationship between the intensification of hostility between democrats and republicans and the deterioration of support for democratic standards? "growing affective polarization and negative partisanship," jennifer mccoy and murat somer, political scientists at georgia state university and koc university-istanbul, write in a 2019 essay, "toward a theory of pernicious polarization and how it harms democracies: comparative evidence and possible remedies," what is affective polarization? in 2016, lilliana mason, a political scientist at johns hopkins, wrote that when a voter's "partisan social identity" merges with his or her racial, religious, sexual and cultural identities, "these various identities work together to drive an emotional type of polarization that cannot be explained by parties or issues alone." mason argues that "threats to a party's status tend to drive anger, while reassurances drive enthusiasm," so one optimistic proposal to reduce partisan animosity is to focus public attention on the commonality of democratic and republican voters in their shared identity as americans. matthew levendusky, a political scientist at the university of pennsylvania, has written extensively on this subject, including in his 2018 paper "americans, not partisans: can priming american national identity reduce affective polarization?" and in his soon-to-be-published book, "our common bonds: using what americans share to help bridge the partisan divide." "i show," levendusky contends in his 2018 paper, "that when subjects' sense of american national identity is heightened, they come to see members of the opposing party as fellow americans rather than rival partisans. as a result, they like the opposing party more, thereby reducing affective polarization." there are serious problems, however, with a depolarization strategy based on american identity, problems that go to the heart of the relentless power of issues of race, ethnicity and immigration to splinter the electorate. in their december 2022 paper, "'american' is the eye of the beholder: american identity, racial sorting, and affective polarization among white americans," ryan dawkins and abigail hanson write: dawkins and hanson acknowledge that "national identity is perhaps the only superordinate identity that holds the promise of uniting partisans and closing the social distance between white democrats and white republicans," but, they continue: in an august 2022 paper, "does affective polarization undermine democratic norms or accountability? maybe not," david e. broockman, a political scientist at berkeley; joshua l. kalla, a political scientist at yale; and sean j. westwood, a political scientist at dartmouth, pointedly reject the claim made by a number of scholars "that if citizens were less affectively polarized, they would be less likely to endorse norm violations, overlook copartisan politicians' shortcomings, oppose compromise, adopt their party's views or misperceive economic conditions. a large, influential literature speculates as such." instead, broockman, kalla and westwood contend, their own studies "find no evidence that these changes in affective polarization influence a broad range of political behaviors -- only interpersonal attitudes. our results suggest caution about the widespread assumption that reducing affective polarization would meaningfully bolster democratic norms or accountability." broockman and his co-authors measured the effect of reducing affective polarization on five domains: "electoral accountability, adopting one's party's policy positions, support for legislative bipartisanship, support for democratic norms and perceptions of objective conditions." "our results," they write, "run contrary to the literature's widespread speculation: in these political domains, our estimates of the causal effects of reducing affective polarization are consistently null." in an email, westwood argued that the whole endeavor "to fix antidemocratic attitudes by changing levels of partisan animosity sounds promising, but it is like trying to heal a broken bone in a gangrenous leg when the real problem is the car accident that caused both injuries in the first place." westwood's point is well taken. in a country marked by battles over sex, race, religion, gender, regional disparities in economic growth, traditionalist versus postmaterialist values and, broadly, inequality, it is difficult to see how relatively short, survey-based experiments could produce a significant, long-term dent in partisan hostility. jan g. voelkel, a sociologist at stanford, and eight of his colleagues report similar results in their october 2022 article "interventions reducing affective polarization do not necessarily improve anti-democratic attitudes." "scholars and practitioners alike," they write, "have invested great effort in developing depolarization interventions that reduce affective polarization. critically, however, it remains unclear whether these interventions reduce antidemocratic attitudes or only change sentiments toward out-partisans." why? in "megastudy identifying successful interventions to strengthen americans' democratic attitudes," a separate analysis of 32,059 american voters "testing 25 interventions designed to reduce antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity," however, voelkel and many of his co-authors -- michael n. stagnaro, james chu, sophia pink, joseph s. mernyk, chrystal redekopp, matthew cashman, james n. druckman, david g. rand and robb willer -- significantly amended their earlier findings. in an email, willer explained what was going on: voelkel and his co-authors found that two interventions were the most effective. the first is known as the braley intervention, for alia braley, a political scientist at berkeley and the lead author of "the subversion dilemma: why voters who cherish democracy participate in democratic backsliding." in the braley intervention, participants are "asked what people from the other party believe when it comes to actions that undermine how democracy works (e.g., using violence to block laws, reducing the number of polling stations to help the other party or not accepting the results of elections if they lose)." they are then given "the correct answer," and "the answers make clear the other party does not support actions that undermine democracy." the second "top-performing intervention" was to give participants "a video showing vivid imagery of societal instability and violence following democratic collapse in several countries, before concluding with imagery of the jan. 6 u.s. capitol attack." "to our knowledge," willer wrote in his email, "this is the first evidence that the same stimuli could both reduce affective polarization and improve some aspect of americans' democratic attitudes, and it suggests these two factors may be causally linked, more than prior work -- including our own -- would suggest." kalla disputed the conclusions willer drew from the megastudy: this intervention, kalla continued, i sent kalla's critique to willer, who replied: i asked levendusky about voelkel's paper on "interventions reducing affective polarization." he replied by email that he was now "convinced that there is no simple path from animosity (or affective polarization) to far downstream outcomes (albeit important ones)," adding that "there's a long way from 'i dislike members of the other party' to 'i will vote for a candidate who broke democratic norms rather than a candidate from the other party' and the process is likely complex and subtle." one scholar, herbert p. kitschelt, a political scientist at duke, contended that too much of the debate over affective polarization and democratic backsliding has been restricted to the analysis of competing psychological pressures, when, in fact, the scope is much larger. the united states, kitschelt wrote in an email, like most of the developed world, the united states is undergoing three disruptive transformations compounded by three additional historical factors specific to the united states, kitschelt suggests. these transformations, he wrote, are: the three factors unique to this country, in his view, are: kitschelt argues that in order to understand affective polarization, it is necessary to go "beyond the myopic and u.s.-centric narrow vision field of american political psychologists." the incentives "for politicians to prime this polarization and stoke the divides, including fanning the flames of affective polarization, can be understood only against the backdrop of these underlying socioeconomic and cultural legacies and processes." kitschelt is not alone in this view. he pointed to a 2020 book, "american affective polarization in comparative perspective," by noam gidron, james adams and will horne, political scientists at harvard, the university of california-davis and georgia state university, in which they make a case that writing just before the 2020 elections, gidron, adams and horne point out that the the study of affective polarization sheds light on how vicious american politics has become and on how this viciousness has enabled trump and those republicans who have followed his lead while hurting democrats, whose policy and legislative initiatives have been obstructed as much as they have succeeded. richard pildes, a professor of constitutional law at n.y.u., addressed this point when he delivered the following remarks from his paper "political fragmentation in democracies of the west" in 2021 at a legal colloquium in new york: what are the chances of reversing this trend?
