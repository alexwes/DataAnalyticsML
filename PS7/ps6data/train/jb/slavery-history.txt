i spent most of this month working on a long piece on using data to understand the trans-atlantic slave trade. it is on the cover of the sunday review this week, if you want to check it out. one of the parts we had to trim for space was a paragraph on the domestic trade within the united states. a significant part of the slave system, the domestic trade relied on the sale of "surplus" slaves from the states of the upper south down to new orleans and beyond. here's what i wrote: in addition to this point, it is also worth saying why there was such a "surplus" to begin with. the short answer is: tobacco. tobacco, for most of the colonial period, was the agricultural backbone of chattel slavery in the south. virginia and maryland were, for all intents and purposes, tobacco colonies, where planters used huge numbers of enslaved people to produce vast amounts of tobacco for european consumption. this extractive agriculture -- practically unavoidable to commodities-driven slave cultivation -- exhausts the soil in fairly short order. that's why slaveholders were one of the engines of american expansion in the first decades of the republic. they needed more and more soil to cultivate tobacco, cotton and other commercial staples. one consequence of this, for the oldest slave economies in north america, was that there were more slaves than were needed to cultivate the land. here's none other than karl marx giving a succinct description of the dynamic in an 1861 essay on "the north american civil war": knowing all this, you can very easily see how the slave system grew in the decades before the civil war. the advent of the cotton gin made it possible to grow huge amounts of cotton in a variety of different environments. as demand for cotton grew as a result of the industrial revolution in britain, so too did the demand for enslaved labor in the south and, in turn, the demand for new land to cultivate. demand for the labor stimulated the slave-breeding economy of the upper south, and demand for land drove native dispossession. as the historian joshua d. rothman notes in "the ledger and the chain: how domestic slave traders shaped america," "the extension of slavery, seen across the atlantic world in the nineteenth century, both furthered and was nurtured by technological, economic, political, and ideological changes that ushered in the modern age." the point i want to make here, both in the essay and in this addendum, is that we should not think of the slave system or the slave trade as somehow about racism and hatred. it was about profit. that's why -- and how -- it lasted so long. and historical analysis aside, to see chattel slavery as part of a system of labor or profit -- to see it as part of a larger class system -- is to better understand the ideas, ideologies and institutions it produced over the course of its life and the ways they shaped, and continue to shape, our world. scholars have spent decades quantifying the slave trade and working to give the public a sense of the true scale of slavery in the atlantic world. it is valuable, important work. but there are real ethical questions around the quantitative study of human atrocity. i wrote about those questions: christopher petrella and justin gomer on the political uses of martin luther king jr. day in boston review. b.d. mcclay on peter bogdanovich's 1968 film "targets" in gawker. kim phillips-fein on the rise of america's far right in the nation. melinda cooper on "family capitalism" and contemporary far-right politics in dissent. this is not a story or essay, but i watched a two-hour analysis of cryptocurrency and nfts by the director and social critic dan olson. it was phenomenal and i highly recommend that you take the time to check it out. feedback if you're enjoying what you're reading, please consider recommending it to your friends. they can sign up here. if you want to share your thoughts on an item in this week's newsletter or

for some other dish. but having made this many times over the past 10 years or so, let me say that it is absolutely fabulous, an easy, no-fuss tomato sauce that tastes great (and leaves your home smelling amazing). as always, for best results, get the best canned tomatoes (and best olive oil) you can find. my neighborhood grocery store, for instance, has a brand of organic d.o.p. san marzano tomatoes that i really like. and i use a very nice italian olive oil that i pick up at my local spice vendor. these things are a little pricier, but i think they're worth it. recipe comes from serious eats. ingredients directions adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300degf (165degc). place tomatoes in a large bowl. crush the tomatoes by squeezing them in your fingers until pieces no larger than  1/2  inch remain. transfer 3 cups of crushed tomatoes to a sealed container and reserve in the refrigerator. heat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large dutch oven until butter is melted. add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. add pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. add tomatoes, carrot, onion, and basil, and stir to combine. season lightly with salt and pepper. bring to a simmer over high heat. cover dutch oven with lid slightly ajar and transfer to oven. cook, stirring once every 1 to 2 hours, until reduced by about half and darkened to a deep red, 5 to 6 hours (reduce oven temperature if the sauce is bubbling too rapidly or the browned bits begin to turn too dark). remove from oven. using tongs, discard onion halves, carrots and basil stems. add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. add fish sauce if using. season generously with salt and pepper, and stir in minced herbs along with additional olive oil as desired. serve immediately, or allow to cool at room temperature, transfer to airtight containers, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. sauce can also be frozen in sealed containers for up to 6 months. to reheat, warm very gently in a saucepan with  1/2  cup water, stirring until it all melts and heats through.
