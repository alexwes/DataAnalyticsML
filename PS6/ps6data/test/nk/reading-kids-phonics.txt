a lovely aphorism holds that education isn't the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire. but too often, neither are pails filled nor fires lit. one of the most bearish statistics for the future of the united states is this: two-thirds of fourth graders in the united states are not proficient in reading. reading may be the most important skill we can give children. it's the pilot light of that fire. yet we fail to ignite that pilot light, so today some one in five adults in the united states struggles with basic literacy, and after more than 25 years of campaigns and fads, american children are still struggling to read. eighth graders today are actually a hair worse at reading than their counterparts were in 1998. one explanation gaining ground is that, with the best of intentions, we grown-ups have bungled the task of teaching kids to read. there is growing evidence from neuroscience and careful experiments that the united states has adopted reading strategies that just don't work very well and that we haven't relied enough on a simple starting point -- helping kids learn to sound out words with phonics. "too much reading instruction is not based on what the evidence says," noted nancy madden, a professor at johns hopkins university who is an expert on early literacy. "that's pretty clear. "at least half of kids in the u.s. are not getting effective reading instruction." other experts agree. ted mitchell, an education veteran at nearly every level who is now president of the american council on education, thinks that easily a majority of children are getting subpar instruction. others disagree, of course. but an approach called the "science of reading" has gained ground, and it rests on a bed of phonics instruction. (i'm focusing on national policy, but parents also play a role. it can be dangerous to listen to kids -- you'll be talked into buying a video game -- so read to them! i've offered my suggestions for the best kids' books ever -- and truly one of the best reasons to have kids is the chance to read to them.) i spent much of the 1980s and 1990s as a new york times correspondent in east asia, and children there (including mine) learned to read through phonics and phonetic alphabets: hiragana in japan, bopomofo in taiwan, pinyin in china and hangul in south korea. then i returned with my family to the united states in 1999, and i found that even reading was political: republicans endorsed phonics, so i was expected as a good liberal to roll my eyes. the early critique of phonics in part was rooted in social justice, trying to address inadequate education in inner cities by offering more engaging reading materials. the issue became more political when the 2000 republican party platform called for "an early start in phonics," and when president george w. bush embraced phonics with a major initiative called reading first. for liberals, bush's support for phonics made it suspect. that had some basis: the reading first program was not well implemented, and careful evaluations showed it had little impact. it died. i became intrigued by the failures in reading after listening to a riveting six-part podcast, "sold a story," that argues passionately that the education establishment ignored empirical evidence and unintentionally harmed children. "kids are not being taught how to read because for decades teachers have been sold an idea about reading and how children learn to do it," emily hanford, a public radio journalist who for years has focused on reading issues, says in the first of the podcasts. she told me that the podcast has had more than 3.5 million downloads. one of the targets of the podcast is lucy calkins, a professor at columbia university teachers college who has a widely used reading curriculum. calkins has acknowledged learning from the science of reading movement and from hanford, and she told me how she has modified her curriculum as a result -- but she also says that phonics was always part of her approach and that media narratives are oversimplified. as calkins and others revise their materials, skeptics worry that curriculums still aren't fully committed to phonics but layer it onto other strategies, leaving students befuddled. it's easy to be glib in describing these reading wars. everyone agrees that phonics are necessary, and everyone also agrees that phonics are not enough. "yes, phonics matters, but how you do phonics matters, too, and the rest of the stuff matters as well," said madden. she runs a nonprofit, success for all, that is one of the most evidence-based organizations for improving reading, and rigorous evaluations have shown excellent results. (success for all was one of the nonprofits in my 2022 holiday giving guide; huge thanks to my readers for donating more than $6 million to them.) what's clear is that when two-thirds of american kids are not proficient at reading, we're failing the next generation. we can fix this, imperfectly, if we're relentlessly empirical and focus on the evidence. it's also noteworthy that lots of other interventions help and aren't controversial: tutoring, access to books, and coaching parents on reading to children. and slashing child poverty, which child tax credits accomplished very successfully until they were cut back. onward.
