let's imagine that someone wanted to design a debate scenario that captured the high-stakes, uncertain, migraine-inducing essence of this freaky election cycle. (don't ask me why. politics makes people do weird stuff sometimes.) the final result could easily wind up looking an awful lot like the senate showdown in pennsylvania on tuesday night between john fetterman and mehmet oz. here we are, two weeks out from election day, with pennsylvania among a smattering of states set to determine which party controls the senate. for various reasons, pennsylvanians have had limited opportunities to take an extended measure of the candidates. with the race now tighter than a bad face-lift, this debate may be the candidates' last big chance for a breakout performance -- or a catastrophic belly-flop. rarely have so many expectations been heaped onto one measly debate. consider the stark contrast between the candidates' core brands. on the republican side, there's dr. oz: a rich, natty, carpetbagging tv celebrity with a smooth-as-goose-poop manner and mephistophelean eyebrows. mr. fetterman, the state's democratic lieutenant governor, is 6-foot-8 and beefy, with tats, a goatee and the sartorial flair of a high school gym teacher -- an anti-establishment, regular-joe type better known for his trash-tweeting than for his oratorical prowess. hovering over this hourlong prime-time matchup are questions about mr. fetterman's health. he suffered a stroke in may that has left him with auditory processing issues, and he will rely on a closed captioning system in the debate. voters can be unforgiving -- and the opposition ruthless -- about verbal stumbling. (just ask president biden.) and the closed captioning technology mr. fetterman uses can lead to lags between questions being asked and answered. already there has been chatter about his performance on the stump. this month, an nbc reporter said that, in a pre-interview sit-down, mr. fetterman seemed to be having trouble understanding her. republicans have accused him of lying about the severity of his condition and suggested he is not up to the job. a major blunder on the debate stage, or even the general sense that mr. fetterman is struggling, could prove devastating. on the other hand ... dr. oz and his team have mocked mr. fetterman's medical travails -- which seems like a particularly jerky move for a medical professional. this may tickle the republican base but risks alienating less partisan voters. in appealing to a general-election audience, dr. oz will need a better bedside manner to avoid coming across as a callous, supercilious jackass. and here's where the dynamic gets really tense: after much back-and-forth between the campaigns, mr. fetterman agreed to only a single debate, pushed to this late date on the campaign calendar. there are no second chances on the agenda, and precious little time to recover if something goes sideways for either candidate. while the particulars of the pennsylvania race are unusual, the minimalist approach to debating is ascendant. for the past decade, the number of debates in competitive races has been on a downward slide, and they appear headed the way of floppy disks and fax machines. this election season, barring unforeseen developments, the major senate contenders in georgia, arizona, north carolina and florida, as in pennsylvania, will face off only once -- which is once more than those in nevada, where debates seem to be off the table altogether. likewise, the republican and democratic candidates in missouri have yet to agree on conditions for appearing together. this trend is not limited to the senate. several candidates for governor have so far opted to shun debates. and starting with the 2024 presidential election, the republican national committee has voted to keep its candidates out of events hosted by the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates unless it overhauls its rules for how the debates are conducted, including when they are held and who can be a moderator. even if the committee eventually backtracks (which seems likely), its threat emphasizes just how far debates have fallen. this is a not-so-great development for a democracy already under strain. once upon a time, candidates felt obligated to participate in debates. but as campaigning increasingly takes place inside partisan bubbles and the ways to directly communicate with voters proliferate, the contenders have become less inclined to brave this arena. why endure intense, prolonged, unscripted scrutiny when it is so much less stressful to post on social media? increasingly, campaigns are deciding these showdowns simply aren't worth the work or the risk involved. but this misses the point. debates aren't supposed to be conducted for the electoral advantage of the candidates. they are meant to benefit the voting public. debates require political opponents to engage face-to-face. they give voters an opportunity to watch the candidates define and defend their priorities and visions beyond the length of a tweet or an instagram post. they are one of the few remaining political forums that focus on ideas. they contribute to an informed citizenry. failure to achieve these aims suggests that the practice should be reformed, not abandoned. admittedly, this seems like wishful thinking as members of both parties grow more comfortable with ducking debates. republicans, in particular, are conditioning their supporters to believe that such matchups, and the journalists who typically run them, are biased against them. those who view debates as some combination of boring, artificial and pointless will probably cheer their decline. (i feel your pain. i really do.) but the loss of this ritual is another troubling sign of our political times, and of a democracy at risk of sliding farther into crisis as its underpinnings are being steadily eroded.
