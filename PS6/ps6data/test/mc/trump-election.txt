marriage is hard. even the happiest couples will occasionally bicker, nitpick or wear on each other's nerves. so consider just how bumpy things could get if someone's thin-skinned, emotionally erratic, accountability-averse husband started criticizing her for his high-profile screw-ups. this apparently has been happening at mar-a-lago, where, post-election, donald trump is flipping out over his key role in the republicans' face-plant in the pennsylvania senate race. mr. trump backed his old buddy mehmet oz, and the celebrity doctor turned out to be a loser. the former president has since been shifting the blame for his poor pick onto everyone else -- including melania trump, according to the times. (mr. trump, of course, hopped on truth social to denounce the "fake story" and insist he "was not at all angry.") by now, mrs. trump must be somewhat accustomed to her hubby's tantrums. still, this round of ragey finger-pointing must be particularly galling, considering that mr. trump didn't just undermine republicans' chances in an eminently winnable senate race. he helped kneecap the party up and down the pennsylvania ballot, giving the democrats in the crucial swing state one of their best election days in ages. how mr. trump manages to turn perfectly winnable races and states into big-time losers might be worth a little reflection (read: panic) among republicans as the former president prepares for his third white house run. this guy has the midas touch in reverse, yet still he's planning a "special announcement" on tuesday night -- despite even some of his former aides' urging him to slow his roll. mr. trump likes to move fast and furious, to keep heads spinning. his embrace of wing-nut candidates in pennsylvania, arizona, michigan and new hampshire not only probably cost republicans potential victories in those battleground states but also offers a sneak peek at what mr. trump could do to his party in 2024 if he's once more at the top of the ticket. of all the places where mr. trump proved toxic, pennsylvania may be where he did the most impressive damage -- a state that will be key to any winning republican presidential contender in 2024. the trumpian fiasco there shows what happens when candidates make the race all about themselves, embracing maga and being out of step with the electorate. in the high-stakes fight for control of the senate, pennsylvania was a hot spot, widely considered the democrats' best opportunity to flip a republican-held seat and, by extension, a must-hold for the g.o.p. dr. oz's high-profile flop was a particularly painful one for mr. trump's party. but there's more: the democrats scored a huge win in the governor's race as well, where josh shapiro had the good fortune of running against doug mastriano, a trump-endorsed maga extremist so unsettling you have to wonder if he is secretly related to marjorie taylor greene. the democrats also triumphed in house races, holding onto vulnerable seats, including the hotly contested 8th and 17th districts. and while a couple of tight races have yet to be called, party leaders are thrilled about already netting 11 seats and being this close to possibly flipping the state house, putting democrats in control of the chamber for the first time in more than a decade. all of this was a step up for them from 2020, when voters went for joe biden over donald trump but picked republicans in some other statewide races. a new legislative map helped boost democrats in the state house battle. but at the core of their success in pennsylvania was candidate quality. the new governor-elect, mr. shapiro, is considered a gifted politician who by all accounts ran a top-notch campaign, stumping tirelessly and raking in campaign cash. "in philly he gave us all the resources we could have needed," said bob brady, a former congressman and longtime chairman of the philadelphia democratic party. and while mr. fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor, gave his party some anxious moments in his senate run, many related to the stroke he suffered days before the may primaries, he is a promising model for democrats looking to compete in other tricky purple places. mr. fetterman's blue-collar, anti-establishment brand helped him sell himself as not just another politician -- and certainly not some snooty blue-state elite. looking to woo voters from beyond his party's usual enclaves, he adopted "every county, every vote" as his campaign mantra and worked the state accordingly -- and successfully. in addition to racking up votes in the areas around philadelphia and pittsburgh, he cut into dr. oz's margins in more conservative regions. independents and moderates broke strongly for mr. fetterman, according to cnn's exit polling. the myriad charms of the top democratic candidates aside, they indisputably benefited from facing trump-approved opponents who, in their respective ways, drew on a trumpian playbook ill suited to woo pennsylvanians. first, dr. oz. this was arguably mr. trump's most straightforward bet that celebrity logically translates into political success. but the daytime-tv host, a longtime resident of new jersey, was ripe for caricature as a slick, rich, elitist carpetbagger. this proved to be an especially fun project for mr. fetterman, who is devoted to the grittier, redder western region of the state. when asked during his lone debate with dr. oz about his loyalties in the fierce intrastate football rivalry between the eagles and steelers, mr. fetterman did not dissemble. "always for the steelers," he said, with a look suggesting the very question was absurd. from the moment dr. oz won the nomination, team fetterman moved to paint him as a jersey interloper, creatively slamming him on social media at every turn. this played into the larger narrative of the republican as "a phony," said sharif street, the state's democratic party chair. dr. oz had no core values, no clear political identity and no real message, mr. street argued, adding that he kept trying to have it "both ways" -- presenting himself as a reasonable moderate in the philly suburbs while playing up his maganess in redder, more rural regions. "everything oz did just appeared to be synthetic," said fletcher mcclellan, a political scientist at elizabethtown college and longtime analyst of the state's politics. there is little question that democrats were more afraid of and would have had a tougher time beating david mccormick, dr. oz's chief opponent in the republican primary. "they really dodged a bullet there," mr. mcclellan said. mr. mastriano, a republican state senator, was an even bigger boon to the democrats. unlike dr. oz, this ultra-maga warrior had plenty of core values. "dark, dark values," mr. street quipped. mr. trump liked mr. mastriano's passionate embrace of the former president's election-fraud lies. but mr. mastriano also went all in on the culture warring, taking a hard-right line on everything from abortion to transgender rights to public school curriculums. at no point did he seem interested in reaching beyond his base. "it never seemed to me like he wanted to be governor -- more like the leader of a movement," mr. mcclellan observed. mr. mastriano was so out there that several of the state's former g.o.p. officials announced their support for mr. shapiro. no one was surprised when the republican fell flat on election day. issues mattered as well. cnn's exit polling identified abortion as the top concern for pennsylvania voters, many of whom may have been put off by the republican state legislature's move this session toward putting an abortion ban on the ballot. (state law requires lawmakers to approve a proposed constitutional amendment in two consecutive sessions before it goes before voters.) still, no one disputes that mr. trump's pathetic candidates helped turn pennsylvania a much bluer shade of purple this cycle. for now at least, the state's democrats may be feeling more fondly toward the former president than many in his own party -- and perhaps even his wife.
