"their agenda is investigative, not legislative." at the top of that agenda is ratcheting up scrutiny of the president's son hunter, whose foreign business dealings have been under investigation by the justice department since the obama administration. a house inquiry would likely be spearheaded by james comer, republican of kentucky, who is expected to chair the house committee on oversight and reform. comer has claimed that the contents of hunter biden's laptop, which was found abandoned in a delaware repair shop in 2020, revealed evidence of federal crimes committed by the president's family. "to the detriment of american interests, joe biden's family traded on his name for profit around the world," comer wrote in the wall street journal last month, outlining his plans for the committee. "if mr. biden's family members have deals with foreign adversaries, it could compromise his decision-making as president in a way that threatens national security." republicans have also signaled their intent to initiate investigations into the origins of the coronavirus (with testimony from anthony fauci, who retired last month); the u.s. withdrawal from afghanistan, during which 13 service members were killed; and the tenure of the homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas, whose handling of the southern border top republicans have characterized as potentially worthy of impeachment. the house has impeached a cabinet member only once in american history, and there seems to be little appetite in the senate for another impeachment trial, even among republicans. and more broadly, some of the party's more moderate members have expressed concern that an inquisitorial strategy will just further alienate the swing voters who prevented a widely anticipated red wave. "i think we have to flex our muscles a little bit more and say, 'we're going to govern america,'" representative don bacon, republican of nebraska, told the washington post. "being against something maybe works in the more hard-right, hard-left districts. i think you have to stand for something, too." biden's most significant legislative achievement -- and by extension, a high-profile target for republican repeal efforts -- was arguably the inflation reduction act, america's largest investment in mitigating climate change. through $370 billion in spending and tax credits set to roll out over 10 years, the law is estimated to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40 percent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. house republicans have already indicated an intent to undermine democrats' climate agenda by dissolving the climate committee that nancy pelosi, the former house speaker, established in 2019. and they are likely to continue blocking biden's push to increase the amount of climate aid that the united states delivers to poor countries, which has emerged as a major sticking point in global climate negotiations. but while republicans have threatened to block the implementation of the inflation reduction act, they have no clear path to doing so under a democratic president and with a democratic senate. "can they block the law? no," jason grumet, the president of the bipartisan policy center, told the times. "can they slow down or entangle implementation? absolutely." the incoming chair of the house energy and commerce committee, cathy mcmorris rodgers, has suggested that republicans would attempt to slow the distribution of climate loans and grants by highlighting examples of supposed boondoggles like solyndra, a solar panel company that received $537 million under president barack obama before going bankrupt. "as we've seen in the past, there will be an attempt to take one or two examples of a failed project or a program that didn't perform so well and try to project that on everything else," said alex mcdonough of pioneer public affairs, a renewable energy lobbying firm. at the same time, there may also be potential for bipartisan legislation to reform the federal permitting process that determines how quickly energy projects can be built, which in turn will help determine how quickly the country can transition away from fossil fuels. a permitting reform measure drafted by senator joe manchin, democrat of west virginia, failed in the senate last year after some of his more progressive colleagues objected that it would facilitate the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure. (my colleague david wallace-wells provided an overview of that debate in his newsletter.) any bill that earns the support of the republican house will most likely meet similar resistance from progressives, but representative garret graves, republican of louisiana, said in november that there were nonetheless "bite-size pieces where we are on the same page." in order to fund budgets congress has approved, it must routinely raise the limit on how much money the federal government can borrow. if it doesn't, the government may have to shut down many public services and could eventually lose the ability to make debt payments, potentially causing a global financial crisis. since the obama administration, republicans have repeatedly attempted to use the threat of a shutdown to advance their policy priorities, in particular deep cuts to social safety net programs like social security and medicare. in 2011 a budget standoff caused the u.s. government's credit rating to be downgraded for the first time. congress resolved another such standoff in december, narrowly avoiding a shutdown, but the government is expected to hit the debt ceiling once again this year. several republicans, including kevin mccarthy, who before tuesday was the front-runner in the contest for house speaker, have said that they would not agree to raise the debt ceiling unless biden and congressional democrats agreed to various demands -- and some have suggested they would not agree to raise it under any circumstances. how serious is the risk? goldman sachs economists warned in a december analysis that bipartisan support to raise the debt limit would be "necessary" but "hard to achieve," comparing the conditions to those in 2011. and on monday, brendan buck, who worked for the last two republican speakers of the house, argued in the times that if republicans failed to elect a speaker on tuesday, as indeed they did, they would "make very clear from the outset they cannot be counted on to fulfill the body's basic responsibilities, such as funding the government and preventing a credit default by lifting the debt ceiling." yet as the 2024 election approaches and a recession looms, some republicans might get cold feet about using the economy as a bargaining chip. "we should have had [that discussion] a long time ago -- to talk about some structural solutions," chuck fleischmann, republican of tennessee, told cnn last month. but, he added, "i think the vast majority of responsible legislators realize this is money already spent and that we can never put the united states in a default position." do you have a point of view we missed? email us at debatable@nytimes.com. please note your name, age and location in your response, which may be included in the next newsletter.
