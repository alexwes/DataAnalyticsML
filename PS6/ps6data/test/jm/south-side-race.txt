sometimes a very special sitcom that has nothing to do with school nonetheless gets you thinking about education and learning. in the case of hbo max's treasure "south side," it has also gotten me thinking about race, culture and even our current notions of alternative forms of objectivity. americans in their 50s are the youngest generation to have been able to take in, more or less, the whole history of american television. black-and-white sitcoms from the 1950s and goofy fantasy shows from 1960s were still shown in syndication when we were kids; we came of age in the 1970s and 1980s; and we have been watching ever since, now experiencing this true golden age of the medium. as a member of that generation, i can say that "south side" -- which completed its third season in december and was canceled just this week -- is certainly one of the top 50 television shows i have ever known. to say that it is about the interlocking adventures of a range of working-class and white-collar black people in chicago on both -- and sometimes shifting -- sides of the law makes it sound like a mere picking up of where the film franchise and tv series "barbershop" and, going back further, the "friday" film series left off. but that doesn't do justice to what a quirkily perfect confection the show is, a mumblecom of sorts that situates into blackness a synthesis of sensibilities that begins with "barbershop" and "friday" but stirs in hints of "seinfeld," "arrested development," "atlanta" and "unbreakable kimmy schmidt." but an element that specifically makes the show work for me is one of its guiding themes: "south side" is about people obsessed with detail. the ensemble show revolves around two friends who work at a rent-to-own furniture store, a pair of neighborhood cops, a vainglorious young alderman and assorted petty criminals swimming in and out of the action. but everyone is doggedly dotting i's and crossing t's, as much in side remarks as in main conversations. "south side" packs so much into even passing exchanges that i have watched some episodes twice just to catch all of the half-sentences and passing facial expressions. chandra russell's marvelous officer turner dutifully warns a man she is working out a modus operandi for dating -- she's referring to hotel floors (you have to be there!): "ok, we're already starting off wrong. i was very clear -- 4 or 6, i didn't say 5. you need to be listening." or she describes her reasoning for why her policing partner will win a choral contest: "my partner is many things. number one, chubby. square, lame, corny. moist, tender-headed -- but you see, choir is all of those things." (let's face it, there is something about choral singing that's "chubby"!) real people don't speak in catalogs like this; it is a glory that the "south side" characters do. the store deliveryman simon (sultan salahuddin) declares himself ready to pull off a task for diallo riddle's feckless alderman character, topping it with a tight little back-and-forth neck move; fellow deliveryman and friend kareme (kareme k. young) whispers behind him "that was good!" as if he is both living the tense moment and experiencing it as art, reveling in the details. in another great moment, kareme shows his bliss that after a bumpy road is repaved, he can now, riding in the passenger seat, wear white while savoring a cup of soup without it spilling. it's always the small things, the details, the getting it right. the lead characters are almost compulsively busy with elaborate schemes from episode to episode, be it a cake-frosting cult, a speed-dating service, a littlepalooza park concert or a cotillion. at one point, in between their shifts hauling furniture, simon and kareme invest in a new cryptocurrency. kareme is writing a sci-fi novel in his spare time. we even get obsessive detail about the past. thieves pen a crime guidebook directing that a particular kind of ruse will require using specifically the laundry detergent tide. we are clearly intended to know that somebody had previously presumed that any detergent would do -- i.e., did not attend to detail -- and came out the worse for it. the idea is not supposed to be that "real" black people aren't like this. the way all of these characters seem to have some degree of o.c.d. is presented as thoroughly organic to their blackness. the exquisite slices of detail-oriented fiction in "south side" get me thinking about something going on in this real world. it is a fashionable idea today that there is an awkward fit between blackness and close reasoning. a major plank in this platform is that antiracism, in its commitment to dismantling structures called white supremacist, must go easy on black kids when it comes to engaging in detail. people can be quite explicit about this, and have been for a while. in 1987, a booklet by the new york state board of regents actually spelled out that black students have "a preference for inferential reasoning rather than deductive or inductive reasoning" and a "tendency to approximate space, number and time instead of aiming for complete accuracy." three years later, a researcher for atlanta's public schools charged that "any tests that emphasize logical, analytical methods of problem solving will be biased against minorities." today, the continuation of this line of thinking calls to de-emphasize a focus on getting the correct answer when teaching black kids math. ibram x. kendi recommends that we do away with standardized tests because the disparate rate of achievement between the races indicates that the tests must be flawed tools when applied to black kids. he asks, "what if we measured intelligence by how knowledgeable individuals are about their own environments? what if we measured intellect by an individual's desire to know?" but wanting to know is different from knowing. and engaging detail about one's neighborhood -- i.e., what the "south side" characters are so very good at -- is natural, while extending that frame of mind to the wider world is ... education. this paradigm is sometimes extended even to black adults. the black physicist chanda prescod-weinstein has argued in a widely read article that physics is mistaken in its foundation upon "white empiricism." she does not specify that a "black" physics would be less concerned with detailed analysis and sequential argumentation -- nor does she specify much about this alternative physics at all. but if higher mathematics and careful deduction are "white," then we must ask: what equally challenging, rigorous tools are there that the "nonwhite" approach would entail? this, too, is how in 2020 the smithsonian national museum of african american history & culture could be comfortable displaying a graphic on its website proudly limning objectivity and the written word as "white." it was taken down when prominent conservatives -- including donald trump jr., no one's idea of an authority -- protested, but the poster exemplified a sense long hanging in the air. i don't accept it. i do not learn from "south side" that black people can only get down to detail in quotation marks, as a kind of temporary stunt like standing on one leg. any sense a modern person has that precision and blackness are a chancy mix is, in my view, likely getting it from perhaps three sources. one, the simplest and most reductive, is that some people just don't think black people are very bright. second is that, as i have covered here in the past, working-class culture in general can turn you away from abstract questions that don't have obvious relevance for everyday life. but that's a race-neutral reality. third, the 1960s led to a factor more specific to the black community: desegregation of schools meant that too often, black kids were placed in schools with openly racist white teachers and students. it was here that the idea began among black teenagers that being a good student was not just nerdy, but "white." what began as a coping mechanism settled in as a teen meme; it was quite innocent, but has been unideal. i see a straight line from these elements in combination to today's notion that being precise is a persnickety nuisance born across the atlantic amid glumly enterprising northern and western europeans. our task is to gently but insistently encourage black kids to apply to abstract endeavors the human capacity for getting down to cases that they easily apply in more local realms -- and savor the pleasure that comes from doing so. a perhaps unlikely analogy to this, for me, is my relationship to sports. i don't like them. never have. i don't do them, i don't watch them, and i know profoundly little about them. i've always been a nerd who likes print rather than moving his body. i wasn't great at sports as a kid and endured being picked last for teams in gym, as well as the nastiness from athletic guys mad that i brought down their team's performance. sports reminds me of that, and a very effective balm for it has been to turn my back on the whole endeavor. a great thing about going to college was knowing that no one could ever again make me run around on a football field. one could make a case that black teenagers calling one another "white" for doing well in school is a similar case -- what began as a protective response and now just feels like a self. my mind tacitly screens out sports. i'm not overtly against them; i just don't see them -- they feel like "not me." my friends tend to be people of similar mind, or at least ones who are ok with me not knowing what sport the bears play or who peyton manning is (i really don't!). i suspect that academics became like that for many black kids after that pan-cultural experience with whites in schools in the 1960s. yet there's more, which i think could be equally applicable to the situation on race and education. i can imagine that another iteration of me could have gotten into sports. i see the appeal from afar. when roughly once a year something requires me to catch a ball, jump into the air or break into a trot, i don't exactly mind, and i envision maybe doing it again sometime soon. as to the fandom, with the lists and scorekeeping, the camaraderie of trading impressions over beers, watching the big games in groups and rewatching highlights, i can see that all of that lends a pleasure similar to, of all things, what i get out of being a theater person. i have the basic equipment to get into sports; i just haven't exercised the muscle. in that vein, i'm not sure why it's conservative to think that an alternate-universe antiracism would eagerly seek to get black kids in touch with engaging in detail, with precision, with getting the right answer when, as in math, we know there is a right answer. charter schools, for example, do it all the time. why is this so often seen as suspiciously "strict" rather than a heartening kind of enlightenment? i know "south side" is just a television comedy. but it is, in its intricately crazy way, a reflection of reality. the characters are heightened, of course, but hardly strange or racially inauthentic. there's a little of that "south side" blackboard-style sense of order in all black people -- as there is in people in general -- and it saddens me to see how easy it is to forget that. the idea that "true" blackness is being vague about details and basing responses to questions on experience local to the self -- i'm sorry, i see nothing proud or constructive in that.
