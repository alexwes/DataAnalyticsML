in his effort to outflank ron desantis, the governor of florida -- his most potent challenger-in-waiting for the republican presidential nomination -- donald trump goes only in one direction: hard right. at the start of this year, trump announced his education agenda, declaring that he would issue mandates to "keep men out of women's sports," end teacher tenure and cut federal aid to any school system that teaches "critical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto our children." "as the saying goes," trump declared, "personnel is policy and at the end of the day if we have pink-haired communists teaching our kids we have a major problem." later in january, trump revealed his "plan to protect children from left-wing gender insanity," in which he promised to bring a halt to "gender-affirming care," to punish doctors who provide gender-affirming care to minors and to pass legislation declaring that "the only genders recognized by the united states government are male and female and they are assigned at birth." "no serious country should be telling its children that they were born with the wrong gender," trump declared. "under my leadership, this madness will end." at one level, these pronouncements reflect trump's determination to prevent desantis from outflanking him. on a larger scale, they reveal a predicament facing not only the former president as he seeks renomination in 2024, but the conservative movement in general, including white evangelicals, the republican party and fox news. trump's strategy requires him to continue his equivocation on white supremacism and his antisemitic supporters and to adopt increasingly extreme positions, including the "termination" of the constitution in order to retroactively award him victory in the 2020 election. the more he attempts to enrage and invigorate his maga base in the republican primaries, the more he forces his fellow partisans and conservatives to follow suit, threatening republican prospects in the coming general election, as demonstrated by the poor showing of trump clones in the 2022 midterm contests. trump's claim that he won in 2020 and his mobilization of an angry, resentful center-right electorate trap him in an approach to elections that has simultaneously ensnared the republican majority in the house, where the speaker, kevin mccarthy, has diluted his own authority in order to empower the party's reactionary fringe -- including such volatile figures as matt gaetz, marjorie taylor greene, paul gosar and lauren boebert. these same forces pushing mccarthy into a corner have prompted fox news to air conspiracy theories network officials knew were untrue for fear of losing market share to conservative media further to the right, disclosures in the dominion voting system's defamation lawsuit against the network revealed. emails and other documents made public in the suit show, for example, that tucker carlson believed that the claims that dominion corrupted its software to allow voter fraud were false: "the software shit is absurd," he wrote. when, however, jacqui heinrich, a fox reporter, tweeted, "there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised," carlson texted his fox colleagues sean hannity and laura ingraham: "please get her fired," adding that "it needs to stop immediately, like tonight. it's measurably hurting the company. the stock price is down. not a joke." "the inclination to conspiracy and paranoia is the bond that links trump to the far right," jeffrey c. herf, a historian at the university of maryland, wrote in an emailed response to my inquiry. "trump without conspiracy theorizing is a nonentity," he added, in a comment with wider applicability to the contemporary conservative movement. trump's core voters, herf continued, "love him for expressing their resentments and for pointing to tangible targets for their anger. trump's 'fine people on both sides' after the neo-nazi riots in charlottesville indicated that he understood very well that his coalition included voters who were both openly racist and antisemitic." republicans in both the house and senate, in herf's view, have acceded to the pressures created by trump and his loyalists in the electorate. in the case of the senate vote on trump's fate after the jan. 6 assault on the capitol, "mitch mcconnell flinched," herf wrote, because he "understood that he and the g.o.p. establishment had made a faustian bargain with the far right, with trump's base, and that without that base the g.o.p. would probably be consigned to becoming a permanent minority party at the national level." mccarthy, in turn, understands "exactly the same dynamic, that is, without paul gosar, scott perry, andy biggs, lauren boebert -- and marjorie taylor greene -- the g.o.p.'s electoral prospects look dim." herf contended that trump's message of 2016 i asked gary jacobson, a political scientist at the university of california, san diego, about trump's 2024 strategy and he wrote in an email: in some respects, jacobson continued, the parallel to fox news, jacobson noted, "is obvious: trump's support depends on continuing to meet expectations he has created; doing otherwise might turn his audience elsewhere." in the view of stella rouse, a political scientist at the university of maryland, trump and the republican party have become so reliant on a hard-right constituency that there is no turning back: the same "is true of the contemporary g.o.p.," rouse argued in an email. "when the party fell in line behind trump in 2016, the horse was out of the barn not only for trump but for those who have embraced and promulgated this politics of grievance. and the 'establishment' wing of the party gets enough ambiguity to justify continued support of trump and these members without much or enough political backlash." i asked joseph uscinski, a political scientist at the university of miami, whether "trump built and became dependent on a coalition that requires him to equivocate on antisemitism, qanon and other extremist expressions for fear of losing any constituency." "yes," uscinski replied by email: there seem "to be two factions in the g.o.p.," uscinski continued, "one more aligned with traditional republicanism and conservatism (e.g., mitt romney) and another more aligned with donald trump or his movement and, consequently, with populism and conspiracism (e.g., marjorie taylor greene). one or the other faction could win this battle in the coming decades, but that depends on how successful either faction is at getting elected." uscinski argued that in this context, uscinski wrote, "the person to watch is desantis. by attempting to appeal to the anti-vaxx crowd, the anti-ukraine crowd and the covid-denying crowd, he is battling trump for the coalition trump built." frances lee, a political scientist at princeton, argued that the republican party has, over time, encompassed an extremist fringe that has not so much grown in recent years but has gained a loudspeaker in the form of social media. in an email she wrote: social media, lee continued, i asked alvin rosenfeld, a professor of english and jewish studies at indiana university, about trump's ambivalent relationship with antisemitism. he replied by email: at bottom, rosenfeld contended, adam enders, a political scientist at the university of louisville who has often written with uscinski about conspiracy thinking, argued in an email: enders said he doubts that trump in their july 2021 paper, "the role of anti-establishment orientations during the trump presidency," enders and uscinski write: sander van der linden, a professor of social psychology at the university of cambridge and the author of the forthcoming book "foolproof: why misinformation infects our minds and how to build immunity," wrote by email: trump, van der linden wrote, van der linden cited a significant difference between the conservative party in england, which regularly rejects conspiracy thinking, and the republican party in the united states, which tolerates and even endorses it. "andrew bridgen, a conservative m.p. and former party whip, was recently suspended by the conservative party after comparing covid-19 vaccines to the holocaust," van der linden wrote, and "boris johnson referred to anti-vaccination activists as spreading completely false 'mumbo jumbo' on social media." the problem in the united states, in van der linden's view, "is that many republican elites, including prominent members of congress, are actively endorsing and spreading conspiracy theories themselves without consequence." van der linden contended that "as long as republican leaders are not willing to actively counter, sanction and condemn members who spread baseless conspiracy theories, the party will continue to be characterized by outrageous falsehoods." the larger question, however, is whether trump and other republican leaders will not only continue to go deeper into the rabbit hole -- a redoubt of victimhood, resentment and conspiracy -- which at the moment appears probable, but whether they will drag the rest of the nation down with them.
