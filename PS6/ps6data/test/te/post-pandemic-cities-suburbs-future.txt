on the last day of february, glen lee, the chief financial officer of washington, d.c., issued a warning to the mayor and members of the district of columbia council, who are undertaking such costly ventures as free bus service and expanded affordable housing. "the covid-19 pandemic," lee wrote, "has brought about significant changes in the district's population and economy, with potential long-term implications." revenue estimates, he said, have "been lowered due to 1) a more pessimistic economic outlook and 2) a deteriorating real property market." in lee's view, there are still more danger signals: washington is not alone. most of the nation's major cities face a daunting future as middle-class taxpayers join an exodus to the suburbs, opting to work remotely as they exit downtowns marred by empty offices, vacant retail space and a deteriorating tax base. the most recent census data "show almost unprecedented declines or slow growth, especially in larger cities," william frey, a demographer and senior fellow at the brookings institution, emailed in response to my query. from july 1, 2020, to july 1, 2021, "new census data shows a huge spike in movement out of big metro areas during the pandemic," frey wrote in an april 2022 paper, including "an absolute decline in the aggregate size of the nation's 56 major metropolitan areas (those with populations exceeding 1 million)." this is the first time, frey continued, "that the nation's major metro areas registered an annual negative growth rate since at least 1990." the beneficiaries of urban population decline are the suburbs. frey wrote: even more damaging to the finances of major cities is the fact that the men and women most likely to move to the suburbs are among the highest-paid key sources of income and property tax revenues: workers with six-figure salaries in technology, finance, real estate and entertainment. those least likely to move, in turn, are paid much less, working in service industries, health care, hospitality and food sales. there is a striking interaction between the covid-driven exodus from the cities and changing racial and ethnic urban populations. from 2020 to 2021, the nation's 56 largest metropolitan areas saw a cumulative decline of 900,000 in their white populations, frey reported. in an august 2022 essay titled "white and youth population losses contributed most to the nation's growth slowdown," frey wrote that, among the metropolitan areas with populations in excess of one million, "43 saw absolute declines in their white populations. sixteen saw absolute declines in their black populations, and six saw declines in latino or hispanic and asian american populations." from 2020 to 2021, the white population of the new york-newark region fell by 222,530, compared with a 39,363 decline among hispanic americans, 53,763 among black americans and 11,485 among asian americans. there were very similar patterns in los angeles-long beach, chicago-naperville-elgin and philadelphia-camden-wilmington. the minority populations of big cities grew substantially from 2010 to 2020, driven by a 1.5 million increase among latinos and a 1.2 million increase among asian americans, while the black big-city population declined by 129,807, according to frey. the population of white people in big cities grew over those 10 years by a modest 239,378. the question facing large cities, especially the older cities in the north, is whether they can break what urban experts now call an urban doom loop. the evidence to date suggests that things are not improving much. nicholas bloom, an economist at stanford, described the overall remote-work pattern in an email: this is a reversal, bloom continued, there are two big losers, according to bloom's calculation: the second set of people to lose, he continued, "are those who own commercial property, since the demand for office buildings is down, rents are down and values are down." despite these losses, bloom argued that, in general, the change in direction is likely to prove beneficial: i pushed bloom on this, asking him, "how can you argue that 'this is mostly good for cities' when so many downtowns have been deserted with office and retail vacancies lining once prosperous main thoroughfares, with restaurants and other amenities disappearing?" bloom replied: whether it's good or bad, bloom provided the times with data suggesting that the current direction is not likely to be reversed. first and foremost, the percentage of days employees worked from home shot up from 5 percent to 60 percent in the early months of the pandemic and then began to decline, stabilizing at just over 25 percent for the last year. at the same time, employers are finding that the opportunity to work two to three days at home is a very attractive perk to be able to offer prospective hires and to keep valued workers. bloom found that, on average, employees view an offer to work part of the week at home as equivalent to an 8 percent raise. if that were not enough, bloom reported that a survey of engineers and marketing and finance professionals found that working from home reduced quit rates by 35 percent. wendell cox -- a founding fellow at the urban reform institute and a principal of demographia, an international public policy firm -- pointed out in a phone interview that the pandemic and the accompanying surge in remote work have wreaked havoc on the transit systems in new york, philadelphia, chicago, boston, los angeles and san francisco. in a study of commuter patterns, cox uncovered "unprecedented declines in (public) transit commuting from 2019 to 2021." new york's "transit market share" fell from 31.7 percent to 19.0 percent during that period; san francisco's fell from 18.1 percent in 2019 to 4.9 percent, with slightly smaller drops in chicago, philadelphia and washington. looking at urban population shifts from 2019 to 2021, cox observed that almost all substantial gains were in sun belt cities: in regional terms, the losers were more of a mixed bag, including such metropolitan areas as san francisco ryan streeter, the director of domestic policy studies at the american enterprise institute, noted in an email that large cities, many in the north, "have grown too expensive (mostly because of housing but also because of taxes) and have been experiencing out-migration even before the pandemic. the pandemic accelerated that in important, and apparently lasting, ways." streeter cited data collected by kastle, a property technology and security consulting firm that tracks how many workers are returning to their offices. he pointed out that "cities that were already growing -- like phoenix, raleigh, austin -- have been bouncing back in healthier ways," while "san francisco, new york and the district of columbia are all below." i asked joel kotkin, a presidential fellow in urban futures at chapman university and the executive director of the urban reform institute in houston, about the economics of major cities, and he replied by email: "the era of urban supremacy is over. the party that addresses this will win. these areas need infrastructure and tax structures that encourage building houses, particularly affordable single-family ones" -- "houses that a couple who work at walmart can afford." this month, kotkin published a decidedly pessimistic piece in unherd, "the ghost of ancient rome haunts america: its great cities are on the path to decay": this downward trajectory preceded the pandemic, and covid accelerated it. "office occupancy has been declining since the turn of the century, along with the construction of new space. in 2019, before the pandemic, construction was one-third the rate of 1985 and half that of 2000," kotkin wrote. more serious, he went on to say, so what is the urban future? kotkin asked and replied to his own question: these peripheral developments, in kotkin's view, "are increasingly places with their own thriving town centers and cultural venues. by lending themselves to remote work and shorter commutes, they also prove ideal for energy efficiency and emissions reductions." traditional cities in a jan. 27 article, "downtown d.c.'s struggles mount as many workers remain remote," paul schwartzman, a reporter for the washington post, captured the sense of devastation permeating the city's once thriving downtown: "it's humbling," lanier told schwartzman, as the third anniversary of the start of the pandemic approached, schwartzman wrote, schwartzman painted a bleak picture, and an even darker one emerged in the cold, hard numbers provided by stijn van nieuwerburgh, a professor of real estate and finance at columbia university's graduate school of business, in his presidential address at the american real estate and urban economics association on jan. 7. "missing office workers in downtown areas have decimated urban retail," nieuwerburgh said, using new york city as a case study: the exodus of these workers is driving a vicious circle, according to nieuwerburgh: if left unchecked, he added, this process "would result in a municipal fiscal crisis. n.y.c. experienced such a crisis in the 1970s, detroit more recently." such a development would be a tragedy. politically, it would be devastating for the democratic party, which already faces voter anger over manifestations of urban dysfunction: homeless encampments, rising homicide rates, rampant crime and a sense of disorder on city streets and in city schools. in 2022 the poverty rate in philadelphia was 22.8 percent; in houston, 19.5 percent; boston, 17.6 percent; new york, 17 percent, all well above the 11.6 percent national rate. in los angeles, 397 residents per 100,000 are homeless; in new york, 394; in seattle-tacoma, 349. the challenge facing cities is that dysfunction tends to engender dysfunction; downward spirals accelerate. covid and remote work have transformed the face of urban america, just as the nation's cities were becoming increasingly racially and ethnically diverse. in many ways, this is a test. it would be difficult to measure the costs of failing to pass such a test.
