it was at noma that i ate the most unsettling meal of my life. the most unsettling dish, i should say, though "dish" doesn't feel right, given that it wriggled and twitched. "you'll never taste a fresher shrimp in your life," the server who presented it to me promised, telling me to plop it in my mouth. but i was as frozen as it was fresh. when he returned minutes later, it was still moving -- more slowly. "it's going to die soon," he said, in the tone of a priest administering last rites. "it might as well die for its intended purpose." all these years later, i have a vivid memory of how fast and hard i chomped down on it, lest it perk up and treadmill on my tongue. i have no recollection of its flavor. there's a metaphor here, and it applies not just to noma, the copenhagen restaurant that stunned the world this week with an announcement that it would close for regular service at the end of next year, but to other internationally renowned, ardently coveted temples of gastronomy that are forever trying to dazzle self-regarding epicures with new stunts, novel sensations, modes of presentation that we hadn't imagined, flora and fauna rarely pinned down on a plate. are they about so many things beyond the fundamentals of dining -- things like ingenuity, philosophy, vanity, eccentricity -- that they've ceased to be restaurants in any conventional and sustainable sense? are they performing such a rococo act for such a rarefied audience that they're on borrowed time? noma has frequently topped rankings of the world's best restaurants since rene redzepi opened it two decades ago and began foraging, pickling and plating his way to outsize fame as a chef of extraordinary vision and exacting principles. but maintaining the standards of innovation and artistry that he'd set for himself -- and that pilgrims to noma expected -- required intricate work and an enormous staff, and julia moskin noted in an article in the times that noma and similarly elite restaurants were "facing scrutiny of their treatment of the workers, many of them paid poorly or not at all." redzepi told moskin that even though a meal at noma is at least $500 per person now, the numbers just weren't adding up. he plans to turn noma into a food laboratory that does occasional pop-up meals. "we have to completely rethink the industry," he said. "this is simply too hard, and we have to work in a different way." "industry" is too broad a term. he's talking about a small, gilded chamber of it. and that chamber is past due for reassessment -- not because it isn't a showcase for phenomenal creativity, not because it isn't a storehouse of remarkable pleasure, but because it has traveled so dizzily far from its truest mission to an altitude that too few people can reach. i write that as someone with enormous regard for redzepi, with whom i spent time in and around copenhagen in 2010. we foraged together in a patch of weeds by the sea. in a restaurant less expensive and more accessible than his, we lunched on smoked salmon and rye bread. we talked and talked. and i was wowed by the amount of thought that he'd put into what he was doing -- by his determination to show diners that with a sense of history, a surfeit of imagination and enough enterprise, he could take the finite patch of earth where he found himself and wring a seemingly infinite bounty of food and flavor from it. at noma, almost everything i ate was either whimsically presented -- langoustines arrived on a craggy rock, around which they did not crawl -- or laboriously sourced. some of it called for a botanical glossary. there was air-dried sea buckthorn. there were pickled ramson flowers. it was fascinating and it was fun and i guess it was delicious, but it intensified a confusion that i had begun to feel -- and had never fully copped to -- during my stint as the restaurant critic of the times from 2004 to 2009. i couldn't tell, when i breached a few of the more exclusive sanctums, whether i was there to eat dinner or to participate in a statement of some kind: about the luxury that i had entry to, about the chef's gastronomic scruples, about ambition, about experimentation. i know i'm not alone. the current restaurant critic of the times, pete wells, has entirely rethought the question of what sorts of establishments deserve attention and adulation. in june he gave three out of four stars to la pirana lechonera, a food trailer in the south bronx that serves puerto rican-style roast pork and is open only on saturdays and sundays. he wrote that it "packs more joy into two days than most restaurants do into a week." joy, along with satiation: that seems to me a restaurant's highest calling, one that doesn't require the elaborate financial and logistical contortions of an ultra-high-end establishment that commits to paying its workers fairly and has customers who demand, or are at least accustomed to, revelatory ingredients and acrobatic preparations. joy, along with satiation: i got them from that smoked salmon and rye. they didn't give me bragging rights or a story to tell. but they didn't ask for much, either. every one of olivia nuzzi's big pieces for new york magazine is a trove of gems, and her spirited end-of-2022 look at the spiritless mar-a-loco launch of donald trump's 2024 presidential campaign was no exception: "on the day he announced his candidacy this past november, the air was heavy with oleander and snipped greenery and sea mist colliding with mold and wood polish and hotel soap and the metallic vapor of diet coke and the alcoholic ferment of generations of cougars in chanel no. 5." (thanks to lori levine of moreland hills, ohio, and willa perlmutter of portland, ore., among others, for nominating this.) the economist contextualized the hubbub over elon musk, twitter and permitted versus censored tweets with this finely turned wisdom: "free expression is not a problem with a solution bounded by the laws of physics that can be hacked together if only enough coders pull an all-nighter. it is a dilemma requiring messy trade-offs that leave no one happy. in such a business, humility and transparency count for a lot." (martha eddison sieniewicz, cambridge, mass.) in the arizona republic, laurie roberts evaluated kari lake's failed lawsuit to overturn state election results: "lake and her attorneys offered no smoking gun. not even a lightly used pea shooter." (diane cook, seattle) in the denver herald, kirsten dahl collins recalled the unusual beginnings of a colorado church: "in the summer of 1860, four armed desperadoes invaded the offices of the newly launched rocky mountain news in denver, gunning for editor william n. byers. luckily for the journalist, two presbyterians walked in." (andy ferguson, denver) in the washington post, tim carman appraised "jose andres and family in spain," a new streaming series: "it's a protracted take your daughters to work day, when your father just happens to be a famous chef -- and one of the world's biggest (non-cured) hams." (alan stamm, birmingham, mich.) in an article in the atlantic titled "the end of the silicon valley myth," brian merchant wrote: "you can just feel it, the cumulative weight of this stagnation, in the tech that most of us encounter every day. the act of scrolling past the same dumb ad to peer at the same bad news on the same glass screen on the same social network: this is the stuck future. there is a sense that we have reached the end of the internet, and no one wants to be left holding the bag." (kevin peters, pomfret center, conn.) kevin mccarthy and his tortured elevation to house speaker inspired much barbed prose, including ty burr's observation, in his substack newsletter, that the republican, um, leader was "being consumed, inch by peristaltic inch, by the boa constrictor he has spent years trying to befriend. (it's a good thing he doesn't have a spine; he'll go down easier.)" (john o'brien, waterford, maine) in the times, michelle goldberg noted that "his mistake was convincing himself that a party obsessed with dominance would reward submission." (tom werthan, freehold, n.j., and lawrence berman, westfield, n.j., among others); paul krugman asked: "for what shall it profit a man, if he shall lose his own soul, and still not gain enough votes to become speaker of the house?" (stephen j. gibbons, davidson, n.c., and chris di nardo, holmdel, n.j.); and bret stephens observed that mccarthy's surrender of prerogatives in order to win ultraconservatives' support "is like a slug abandoning its shell and thinking it won't be stepped on." (joanne hickey, ossining, n.y., and marci imbrogno, charlotte, n.c., among others) also in the times, peter staley reflected on the vilification of dr. anthony fauci: "there has rarely been a larger gap between a mob's viciousness and its target's decency." (virginia miller, melrose, n.y.) jan hoffman described the physical toll of one woman's injections of a mix of fentanyl and a veterinary tranquilizer that's infiltrated the supply of street drugs: "from wrist to elbow, her meandering pink and purple scars are a road map of being lost and found." (heather miller, brooklyn, n.y.) carlos lozada pondered trump: "when you suck all the air out of the room, you risk bursting." (laurie abel, manhattan) manohla dargis reviewed "babylon": "at the inaugural bacchanal, the camera doesn't soar; it darts and swoops like a coked-up hummingbird." (louise nameth, patchogue, n.y.) pete wells placed the new restaurant corner bar "in that ambiguous piece of downtown where chinatown and the lower east side meet and seem to run out of steam." (jim eppard, north potomac, md.) and megan stack plumbed the lows of our country's perpetual sugar high: "if america's candy culture is a symptom, then we adults must be the disease -- frightened for the future, harried by daily cares, snatching up a cheap simulacrum of happiness that's already melting once it hits the tongue." (ray allen, baltimore) to nominate favorite bits of recent writing from the times or other publications to be mentioned in "for the love of sentences," please email me here, put "sentences" in the subject line and include your name and place of residence. regan can't see the forest for the tree. that's correct -- tree. singular. it's up a hill on the far side of the creek that runs through our neighborhood, and like a siren, it beckons her. like a magnet, it pulls her. and then, like a crystal ball, it ensorcels her. it doesn't look much different from the countless trees around it, except that it has a snout-level indent -- a nook, really -- that must have once been the abode of some creature she yearns to meet (or eat). is it still inhabited? i've never detected any movement. but regan smells something. or senses something. or simply imagines something. these are distinctions without a difference, because whatever is or isn't happening in that lilliputian cave has held her rapt for months now. for a full year, actually. she studies the nook from various angles. she sniffs inside. she lurches forward, only to rear back. her tail wags; her tail stills. i walk onward, down one of the nearby trails. she always follows a few minutes later, and while i like to think she's choosing me over tree, i suspect she simply knows we'll be circling back at walk's end. her vigil isn't abandoned. it's just interrupted. dogs teach us as much as we're willing to learn -- about loyalty, about longing, about grit -- but what's the lesson here? for a long time i wanted a parable with a tidy moral about sweetly stubborn hope or stupidly unbreakable habit. then, recently, i realized that there was another way to look at it. a simpler one. the tree makes regan happy. she likes sprinting toward it. she likes standing beside it. she likes its constancy. she likes its mystery. having stuck her nose into much of this world, she has found a crevice that tickles it like no other. why insist on any logic other than that?
